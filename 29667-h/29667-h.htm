<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN STRATHMORE&#8217;S PASSENGER</h3>
</div>
<p>A few hours before the sailing of the steamer <i>Polynesia</i>,
from San Francisco to Japan, and while Captain
Strathmore stood on deck watching the bustle and
hurry, he was approached by a nervous, well-dressed
gentleman, who was leading a little girl by the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you to take a passenger to Tokio for me,
Captain Strathmore,&#8221; said the stranger.</p>
<p>The honest, bluff old captain, although tender of
the feelings of others, never forgot the dignity and
respect due to his position, and, looking sternly at the
stranger, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You should know, sir, that it is the purser and not
the captain whom you should see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have seen him, and cannot make a satisfactory
arrangement.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And that is no reason, sir, why you should approach
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain was about moving away, when the
stranger placed his hand on his arm, and said, in a
hurried, anxious voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not I who wish to go&ndash;&ndash;it is this little girl.
It is a case of life and death; she must go! You, as
captain, can take her in your own cabin, and no one
will be inconvenienced.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time Captain Strathmore looked down
at the little girl, who was staring around her with the
wondering curiosity of childhood.</p>
<p>She was apparently about six years of age, and the
picture of infantile innocence and loveliness. She
was dressed with good taste, her little feet being incased
in Cinderella-like slippers, while the pretty
stockings and dress set off the figure to perfection.
She wore a fashionable straw hat, with a gay ribbon,
and indeed looked like a child of wealthy parents, who
had let her out for a little jaunt along some shady
avenue.</p>
<p>When Captain Strathmore looked down upon this
sweet child, a great pang went through his heart, for
she was the picture of the little girl that once called
him father.</p>
<p>Her mother died while little Inez was an infant,
and, as soon as the cherished one could dispense with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
the care of a nurse, she joined her father, the captain,
and henceforth was not separated from him. She
was always on ship or steamer, sharing his room and
becoming the pet of every one who met her, no less
from her loveliness than from her childish, winning
ways.</p>
<p>But there came one awful dark day, away out in
the Pacific, when the sweet voice was hushed forever,
and the rugged old captain was bowed by a grief such
as that which smites the mountain-oak to the earth.</p>
<p>The little girl who now looked up in the face of
Captain Strathmore was the image of Inez, who years
before had sunk to the bottom of the sea, carrying
with her all the sunshine, music and loveliness that
cheered her father&#8217;s heart. With an impulse he could
not resist, the captain reached out his arms and the
little stranger instantly ran into them. Then she was
lifted up, and the captain kissed her, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;You look so much like the little girl I buried at
sea that I could not help kissing you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The child was not afraid of him, for her fairy-like
fingers began playing with the grizzled whiskers,
while the honest blue eyes of the old sailor grew dim
and misty for the moment.</p>
<p>The gentleman who had brought the child to the
steamer saw that this was a favorable time for him to
urge his plea.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That is the little girl whom I wished to send to
Tokio by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you no friend or acquaintance on board
in whose care you can place her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know a soul.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she any relative of yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is my niece. Her father and mother are missionaries
in Japan, and have been notified of her coming
on this steamer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that were so, why then were not preparations
made for sending her in the care of some one, instead
of waiting until the last minute, and then rushing
down here and making application in such an irregular
manner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her uncle, the brother of my wife, expected to
make the voyage with her, and came to San Francisco
for that purpose. He was taken dangerously ill at the
hotel, and when I reached there, a few hours ago, he
was dead, and my niece was in the care of the landlord&#8217;s
family. My wife, who is out yonder in a carriage,
had prepared to accompany me East to-morrow.
Her brother had made no arrangements for taking
the little one on the steamer, so I was forced into
this unusual application.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the gentleman was making this explanation,
the captain was holding the child in his arms, and admiring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
the beautiful countenance and loveliness of
face and manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;She does look exactly like my poor little Inez,&#8221;
was his thought, as he gently placed her on her feet
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we take her to Japan, what then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her parents will be in Tokio, waiting for her.
You, as captain, have the right, which no one would
dare question, of taking her into your cabin with you,
and I will compensate you in any manner you may
wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is her name?&#8221; asked Captain Strathmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She shall go,&#8221; said the sailor, in a husky voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE CAPTAIN AND INEZ</h3>
</div>
<p>The steamer <i>Polynesia</i> was steaming swiftly across
the Pacific, in the direction of Japan&ndash;&ndash;bravely plunging
out into the mightiest expanse of water which
spans the globe, and heading for the port that loomed
up from the ocean almost ten thousand miles away.</p>
<p>Although but a few days out, little Inez had become
the pet of the whole ship. She was full of high
spirits, bounding health&ndash;&ndash;a laughing, merry sprite,
who made every portion of the steamer her home, and
who was welcome wherever she went.</p>
<p>To the bronzed and rugged Captain Strathmore
she was such a reminder of his own lost Inez that she
became a second daughter to him, and something like
a pang stirred his heart when he reflected upon his
arrival at his destination and his parting from the
little one.</p>
<p>Inez, as nearly as the captain could gather, had
been living for several years with her uncle and aunt
in San Francisco, from which port her parents had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
sailed a considerable time before. The stranger gave
a very common name as his own&ndash;&ndash;George Smith&ndash;&ndash;and
said he would await the return of the <i>Polynesia</i>
with great anxiety, in order to learn the particulars
of the arrival of his niece in Japan.</p>
<p>However, the captain did not allow his mind to be
annoyed by any speculations as to the past of the little
girl; but he could not avoid a strong yearning which
was growing in his heart that something would turn
up&ndash;&ndash;something possibly in the shape of a social revolution
or earthquake&ndash;&ndash;that would place the little girl
in his possession again.</p>
<p>And yet he trembled as he muttered the wish.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long would I keep her? I had such a girl
once&ndash;&ndash;her very counterpart&ndash;&ndash;the sweet Inez, my
own; and yet she is gone, and who shall say how long
this one shall be mine?&#8221;</p>
<p>The weather remained all that could be wished for
a number of days after steaming out of the Golden
Gate. It was in the month of September, when a
mild, dreamy languor seemed to rest upon everything,
and the passage across the Pacific was like one long-continued
dream of the Orient&ndash;&ndash;excepting, perhaps,
when the cyclone or hurricane, roused from its sleep,
swept over the deep with a fury such as strews the
shores with wrecks and the bottom with multitudes of
bodies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></div>
<p>What more beautiful than a moonlight night on the
Pacific?</p>
<p>The <i>Polynesia</i> was plowing the vast waste of waters
which separates the two worlds, bearing upon her
decks and in her cabins passengers from the four
quarters of the globe.</p>
<p>They came from, and were going to, every portion
of the wide world. Some were speeding toward their
homes in Asia or Africa or the islands of the sea; and
others living in Europe or America, or the remote
corners of the earth, would finally return, after wandering
over strange places, seeing singular sights, and
treading in the footsteps of the armies who had gone
before them in the dim ages of the past.</p>
<p>Now and then the great ship rose from some mighty
swell, and then, settling down, drove ahead, cleaving
the calm water and leaving a wide wake of foam behind.
The black smoke poured out of the broad funnels,
and sifted upward through the scant rigging, and
was dissipated in the clear air above. The throbbing
of the engine made its pulsations felt through the ponderous
craft from stem to stern, as a giant breathes
more powerfully when gathering his energy for the
final effort of the race. A few drifting clouds moved
along the sky, while, now and then, a starlike point
of light, far away against the horizon, showed where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
some other caravansary of the sea was moving toward
its destination, thousands of leagues away.</p>
<p>Although Captain Strathmore was on duty, and
it was against the rules for any passenger to approach
or address him, yet there was one who was unrestrained
by rules or regulations, no matter how
sternly they were enforced in other cases.</p>
<p>The captain was standing on the bridge, when he
felt some one tugging at his coat, and he looked down.</p>
<p>There was Inez demanding his attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me up, pop,&#8221; said she.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless your heart!&#8221; laughed the captain as he
obeyed the little empress; &#8220;you would ruin the discipline
of a man-of-war in a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>While speaking, he perched her on his shoulder, as
was a favorite custom with him.</p>
<p>The day had been unusually warm, and the night
was so mild that the steady breeze made by the motion
of the steamer was scarcely sufficient to keep one cool.
Little Inez had thrown aside her hat with the setting
of the sun, and now her wealth of golden hair
streamed and fluttered in fleecy masses about her
shoulders.</p>
<p>The steamer was plowing straight to the westward,
cutting the waves so keenly that a thin parabola of
water continually curved over in front of her from the
knife-like prow.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></div>
<p>Perched aloft on the shoulder of the captain, Inez
naturally gazed ahead, and the figure was a striking
one of innocence and infancy peering forward through
the mists and clouds toward the unknown future. But
Inez was too young to have any such poetical thoughts,
and the captain was too practical to be troubled by
&#8220;&aelig;sthetic meditations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He chatted with her about their arrival in Japan,
saying that she would be glad to see no more of him,
when she replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you talk that way, I&#8217;ll cry. You must go home
and live with us. Uncle Con says papa has a big dog,
and if we haven&#8217;t room in the house, you can sleep
with him, and I&#8217;ll feed you each morning&ndash;&ndash;oh, look!&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_III_AN_ACCIDENT' id='CHAPTER_III_AN_ACCIDENT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AN ACCIDENT</h3>
</div>
<p>That which arrested the attention of the little girl
in the arms of Captain Strathmore, was a sight&ndash;&ndash;unique,
rare and impressively beautiful.</p>
<p>All around the steamer stretched the vast Pacific,
melting away into darkness, with here and there a
star-like twinkle, showing where some ship was moving
over the waste of waters. Overhead, the sky was
clear, with a few stars faintly gleaming, while the
round, full moon, for whose rising so many on the
steamer had been watching, had just come up, its disk
looking unusually large, as it always does when so
close to the horizon.</p>
<p>Just when the moon was half above the ocean, and
when the narrowing path of the illumination stretched
from the ship to the outer edge of the world, a vessel
under full sail slowly passed over the face of the
moon.</p>
<p>The partial eclipse was so singular that it arrested
the attention of Inez, who uttered the exclamation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
we have recorded. It was seen by nearly all the passengers,
too, most of whom were looking toward the
horizon for the rising of the orb, and expressions of
delight were heard from every quarter, for such a
sight, we say, is rare.</p>
<p>When observed by the passengers on board the
<i>Polynesia</i>, the moon had barely cleared the horizon,
as we have stated, and the top of the mainmast just
reached the uppermost portion of the periphery, while
spars, rigging and hull were marked against the yellow
disk as distinctly as if painted in India ink.</p>
<p>Such an obscuration, like a total one of the sun,
could last but a few seconds, for the <i>Polynesia</i> and the
other ship were moving in opposite directions, while
the moon itself was creeping upward toward the
zenith. Slowly the black ship glided toward its destination&ndash;&ndash;hull,
masts and rigging gradually mingled
with the gloom beyond, until the moon, as if shaking
off the eclipse, mounted upward with its face unmarred,
excepting by the peculiar figures stamped
there when it was first launched into space.</p>
<p>When the wonderful exhibition was over there were
murmurs of admiration from the passengers, who,
grouped here and there, or promenading back and
forth, had stood spellbound, as may be said, while it
was in progress.</p>
<p>Captain Strathmore and two of his officers had seen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
the same thing once or twice before, but they had been
favored in this respect above others, and could hardly
expect anything of the kind again.</p>
<p>The captain now prepared for an interesting and
novel ceremony, which he had announced would take
place that evening by moonlight.</p>
<p>Descending to the deck, and approaching the stern,
where the expectant passengers had gathered together,
the group were silent a minute, while he stood among
them holding little Inez by the hand. A few minutes
later the purser came aft, carrying a parcel in his
hand, which he carefully placed upon the taffrail.
Then he spoke in a sepulchral voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ladies and gentlemen, we all have lost minutes
and hours, but it is seldom that we deliberately throw
away a day. But we are to do so now. We are about
to bury a day. To-day is the Twentieth, to-morrow
will be the Twenty-second, and where, then, is the
Twenty-first? There it lies&#8221; (pointing to the parcel
on the taffrail). &#8220;Life is short enough, without deliberately
casting an entire day into the sea; but there
is the consolation of knowing, on your return, that it
shall be restored to you, and thus beautifully does nature
preserve the equilibrium throughout the world.
What more fitting than that the day should be buried
by the hands of one whose life is as spotless as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
snow upon the peaks of the Sierras we have left behind
us?&#8221;</p>
<p>All now uncovered their heads&ndash;&ndash;that is, the gentlemen
did&ndash;&ndash;and the captain advanced, leading Inez
Hawthorne by the hand. Holding her up a short distance
from the deck, she called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, Twenty-first of September!&#8221;</p>
<p>She repeated the words correctly, for the captain
whispered them in her ear, and as she spoke she gave
the parcel a slight shove, and overboard it went, striking
the water with a splash, and instantly sinking
out of sight. The package was nothing but some old
iron, wrapped about with coarse brown paper.</p>
<p>The ceremony of burying a day, as the reader
knows, is a common, and it may be said, a necessary,
one with vessels sailing westward over the Pacific, as
the picking up of a day is necessary on the return.
At first sight it seems incongruous, but it is in fact
the only way in which the reckoning of time can be
kept correctly.</p>
<p>The little ceremony naturally caused the matter
itself to become one of discussion, and probably a
goodly number of young ladies and gentlemen picked
up more knowledge of the matter than they had ever
dreamed of before.</p>
<p>Two curious things happened within a half hour
of this novel ceremony.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></div>
<p>The <i>Polynesia</i> was driving along with that steady
motion in which the throbbing of the vessel can only
be detected by carefully standing still and watching
for it, when every passenger, and especially the captain
and his officers, suddenly felt an alarming jar,
which shook the steamer from stem to stern. It was
noticed that the engine instantly stopped and the enormous
ship gradually came to rest upon the long, heaving
swell of the Pacific.</p>
<p>In a few minutes it was ascertained that the
steamer had broken the shaft of her propeller, thus
rendering the all-important screw useless. This necessitated
the hoisting of her sails, and a monotonous
voyage to her destination, a return to San Francisco,
or a long deviation to Honolulu for repairs.</p>
<p>While the necessary investigation was going on, a
sail had been sighted bearing down upon them, and
in half an hour it came-to, a short distance off, in the
hope of being able to afford some assistance&ndash;&ndash;as the
sight of a steamer lying motionless on the water meant
that something was amiss.</p>
<p>This new craft was the schooner <i>Coral</i>, a stanchly-built,
sharp-bowed little vessel of forty tons burden,
built for the Honolulu trade. She was about seven
years old, very fast, and constructed as strongly as
iron and wood could make her. The forecastle, cook&#8217;s
quarters and cabin were all under deck, so that in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
heavy weather there was no danger of being washed
from one&#8217;s bunk whenever a big sea came thundering
over the rail.</p>
<p>The skipper or captain of this trim little craft was
Jack Bergen, of Boston, and he with his mate, Abram
Storms, had made the trip across the continent by rail
to San Francisco&ndash;&ndash;thus saving the long, dangerous
and expensive voyage around Cape Horn.</p>
<p>In the Golden Gate City they&ndash;&ndash;for the mate and
captain were joint partners&ndash;&ndash;bought the <i>Coral</i> at auction,
paying just two-thirds the sum they expected to
give for the vessel they needed. However, when she
was fitted up and provisioned, they found very little
of their funds left, and they could but feel some
anxiety as to the result of the extraordinary enterprise
upon which they were engaged. The crew of the little
schooner consisted of the two sailors, Hyde Brazzier,
Alfredo Redvignez, and a huge African, Pomp
Cooper, who shipped as cook and steward, with the liability
of being called upon to do duty in an emergency.</p>
<p>But of these, more hereafter.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen, after his craft came-to, was rowed
across the short, intervening distance with his mate,
and they were assisted upon deck, where they were received
most courteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything I can do to help you?&#8221; he asked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
after he and his brother officer were received by Captain
Strathmore.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m obliged to you, but I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; was the
courteous response. &#8220;You know, there&#8217;s no way of telling
when a piece of iron is going to fracture, and so
there is no way of providing against such an accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the shaft broke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; broken clean off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain of the steamer smiled, for he saw no
need of such a question, since he considered the damage
irremediable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a distance from the screw, and it&#8217;s a curious
fracture. Would you like to look at it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would, indeed. You see, we have got considerable
out of our course&ndash;&ndash;being too far west&ndash;&ndash;and we
shall make a pretty sharp turn to the south, toward
Honolulu.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am debating whether to go there, turn back to
San Francisco, or keep on under sail to Tokio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my mate, Abram Storms, from Enfield,
Connecticut,&#8221; said Captain Bergen, introducing the
two. &#8220;I bring him along because he is the most ingenious
man ever turned out by that home of ingenuity;
and when I saw that something was the matter
with you, I came alongside, more because I believed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
he could help you, than in the expectation that I could
be of any service.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain Bergen does me too much honor,&#8221; protested
the stoop-shouldered New Englander, who, had
there been more of daylight, would have been seen to
blush under the compliment.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no doubt he speaks the truth,&#8221; replied
Captain Strathmore, leading the way below to where
the broken shaft rested motionless; &#8220;but this trouble
is too much like a broken neck for any surgery to
help.&#8221;</p>
<p>A minute later, a group of half a dozen stood about
and stooped over the broken shaft, and examined it
by the aid of lanterns, the chief engineer showing a
more courteous spirit than is usual under such circumstances.</p>
<p>As one looked at the huge cylinder of solid iron,
gleaming with a silvery whiteness all over the jagged
face where it had been twisted off, the wonder was
how it could be possible for any force to be tremendous
enough to do such damage. The peculiarity
about the breakage, however, was that, instead of
snapping nearly squarely off, the fracture extended
longitudinally for fully eighteen inches, so that the
face of each part was a great deal broader and longer
than is generally the case in such accidents.</p>
<p>The group surveyed it a minute or two in silence,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
stooping down and feeling of the innumerable jagged
protuberances, the indentations, and the exceedingly
rough surface, the minute particles gleaming in the
lamp-light like a mass of silver ore split apart.</p>
<p>The first remark came from the New Englander,
Abe Storms.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is curious, for there are no signs of crystallization,
nor can I detect a flaw.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, it must be there, for perfect iron
would not have broken in that manner,&#8221; said the chief
engineer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon,&#8221; said the mate, courteously,
&#8220;but it frequently happens. There has been some peculiar
combination of the movement of the steamer on
the swell of the sea, with the position of the screw at
that moment&ndash;&ndash;a convergence of a hundred conditions&ndash;&ndash;some
almost infinitesimal, but necessary, and which
convergence is not likely to take place in a million
revolutions of the screw&ndash;&ndash;that has brought an irresistible
strain upon the shaft&ndash;&ndash;one that would have
wrenched it off, had the diameter been twice what
it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group looked wonderingly at the speaker, for
every intelligent man felt that the theory of the New
Englander had a stratum of truth beneath it. It was
hard to make clear what the mate meant, but all to a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
certain extent understood, and no one ventured to
gainsay it.</p>
<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; added Abe Storms, &#8220;there&#8217;s one good
thing about this; it will be easy to mend it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen smiled, for he expected something
of the kind, and he knew that that wonderful Yankee
mate of his never boasted, and would demonstrate
every assertion he made. But the others stared at the
speaker with something like consternation, and
seemed to be debating whether he was crazy or a natural
born idiot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>MISSING</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Mend a broken shaft?&#8221; repeated the chief engineer,
in amazement. &#8220;How do you expect to do
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will show you,&#8221; replied the mate of the little
schooner, who immediately proceeded to business.</p>
<p>The first thing he asked for was several coils of
wire, which were immediately furnished him. Then,
with great labor, the two parts of the shaft were fitted
together and the wire was twisted tightly around the
fractured portion over and over again.</p>
<p>As the tenacity of iron is tremendous, the shaft was
securely fastened, but this was not enough. Ropes
and chains were bound around the iron in turn, until
there was really no room to bandage the broken shaft
further.</p>
<p>&#8220;There, sir!&#8221; exclaimed Storms, as he stepped back
and viewed his work. &#8220;That is as secure as before,
though, if you can possibly do so, you should avoid reversing
the screw until you reach Tokio, for you can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
understand that to reverse and start will wrench the
shaft to a dangerous degree.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain now told the engineer, who had been
assisting in the operation, to start the engine slowly
and with great care.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen ran on deck to see that the <i>Coral</i>
was in position to receive no harm from the forward
motion, while the rest of the group watched the movements
with intense interest, standing away from the
shaft so as to escape the &#8220;splinters,&#8221; that more than
one thought might be flying about their heads the next
minute.</p>
<p>There came the sound of steam, of plunging rods
and cylinders from ahead, then there was heard a
furious splash at the stern, and all saw that the shaft
in its entirety was revolving.</p>
<p>The keen eyes of Abe Storms, who had leaned directly
over his handiwork, lamp in hand, his nose almost
touching the gleaming chains, detected the very
yielding which he had prophesied. He heard the
creaking of the chains, the faint gasping, as it may be
called, of the rope, and the soft grinding of the fine
wire beneath.</p>
<p>All this showed what an enormous strain was
brought upon them, and almost any other person detecting
the rasping of the ragged edges of iron against
each other would have started back appalled, believing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
that everything was about to fly apart. But it was
precisely what the mate expected, and what was inevitable
under the circumstances. Then, at his request,
the engineer was ordered to put on a full head
of steam, and the <i>Polynesia</i> plowed forward, cleaving
the water before her.</p>
<p>Abe Storms knelt down and bent almost lovingly
over the round mass revolving on its axis. Then he
beckoned to the engineer to approach and do the same.
He obeyed, as did several others, and placing their
ears close, they listened intently to the revolution of
the shaft.</p>
<p>Not even the faintest noise could be detected to
show that there was anything but a normal movement
of the shaft. Every one saw, too, that the revolutions
were not only going on regularly, but would continue
so for an indefinite time. The shaft was practically
whole again, with the exception that a reverse movement
would be likely to undo everything, and by
scraping the corrugated surfaces of the fractures, render
it impossible to do anything of the kind again.</p>
<p>Captain Strathmore and his officers stood for a full
hour more steadily watching the revolving shaft, and
at the end of that time they were satisfied. Then the
new acquaintances saluted and bade each other good-by,
the officers of the <i>Coral</i> passing over the rail, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
were rowed back to their own vessel, which had followed
in the wake of the steamer, as may be said.</p>
<p>By this time it was midnight, and the captain returned
to his station on the bridge, reflecting to himself
that some of the most insurmountable difficulties,
apparently, are overcome by the simplest means, and
that there are some persons in the world who really
seem capable of inventing anything.</p>
<p>The hour was so late that all the passengers had retired,
and little Inez, as a matter of course, had become
invisible long before. She had declared several
times that she was going to sit up with the captain,
and she tried it, but, like most children under such
circumstances, she dropped off into slumber by the
time it was fairly dark, and was carried below to the
cabin.</p>
<p>The child was like so much sunshine flitting hither
and thither upon the steamer, and whose presence
would be sorely missed when the hour came for her
to go. But Captain Strathmore was a disciplinarian,
who could never forget his duty, and he remained at
his post until the time came for him to go below to
gain the few hours&#8217; sleep which cannot be safely dispensed
with by any one, no matter how rugged his
frame.</p>
<p>Tumbling into his berth, he stretched out with a
sigh of comfort, and went to sleep.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Inez will be in here bright and early to wake me,&#8221;
was his conclusion, as he closed his eyes in slumber.</p>
<p>But he was disappointed, for when he was called
from his couch, it was not by the little one whom he
expected to see. At the breakfast-table she did not
appear, and then Captain Strathmore, fearing that
she was ill, made inquiries. He heard nothing, and
filled with a growing alarm, he instituted a thorough
search of the vessel from stem to stern and high and
low. Not a spot or corner was omitted where a cat
could have been concealed, but she was not found.</p>
<p>And then the startling truth was established that
little Inez Hawthorne was not on board the steamer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; groaned poor Captain Strathmore, &#8220;she became
my own child! Now I have lost her a second
time!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>THE NEW PASSENGER</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Strathmore rewarded Abe Storms liberally
for the service he had rendered them, and the
mate and captain of the schooner, as we have said,
were rowed back to the boat by Hyde Brazzier.</p>
<p>Reaching the deck of the <i>Coral</i>, they watched the
progress of the great steamer until she vanished from
sight in the moonlight, and then the two friends went
into the cabin to &#8220;study the chart,&#8221; as they expressed
it.</p>
<p>It may be said that this had been the principal
business of the two since leaving the States, though
the statement is not strictly correct. The hum of conversation
went on for hours; the night gradually wore
away, but still the two men sat talking in low tones,
and looking at the roll of paper spread out between
them, and which was covered with numerous curious
drawings. The theme must have been an absorbing
one, since it banished all thought of the passage of
time from their minds.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I tell you,&#8221; said the captain, as he leaned back in
his chair, &#8220;there isn&#8217;t the remotest doubt that a colossal
fortune is awaiting us, and unless some extraordinary
accident intervenes, we shall gather it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it would seem,&#8221; replied the mate, with a weary
look, &#8220;and yet I sometimes feel certain that it will
never be ours&ndash;&ndash;Good gracious!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men almost leaped out of their chairs, and
their hair fairly rose on end. They were absolutely
certain that no one else was in the cabin besides themselves.
Redvignez was at the wheel, and Brazzier
awaited his call in turn at the end of the watch. But
just then both heard a rustling, and saw a movement
in the berth of Captain Bergen, which showed something
was there. It couldn&#8217;t be a dog or cat, for there
was nothing of the kind on board. Besides which,
just then, the two men caught sight of the little white
hand which clearly belonged to some one of their own
species. Then the covering was thrown back; a mass
of tangled golden hair was observed, and instantly
after, the fair face of a young child peered wonderingly
out, as if seeking to learn where she was.</p>
<p>Of course the little one was Inez Hawthorne,
though neither of the two men had ever seen or heard
of her before, and it is, therefore, idle to attempt to
picture their overwhelming astonishment when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
became aware so suddenly of her presence in the
cabin.</p>
<p>Neither of the two men was superstitious; but there
was good excuse for their being wonder-struck. If
an individual in the middle of a desert should suddenly
become aware of the appearance of a strange
person at his elbow, a situation apparently in which
he could only be placed by supernatural means, it
would be a very mild word to say he would be surprised.</p>
<p>Flinging the coverlet from her shoulders and throwing
back her mass of rich golden hair, Inez assumed
the sitting position, with her dimpled legs swinging
over the side, and her little hands resting on the rail,
as if to steady herself during the long swells of the
sea, while she looked at the two men as if trying to
recollect where she was and who they were.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if that doesn&#8217;t beat anything that was ever
heard or read of before!&#8221; exclaimed the captain, turning
about and staring at her. &#8220;Where in the name of
the seven wonders did you come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>Abe Storms, the mate, did not speak, but seemed
to be waiting to see whether the child had a voice, and
thus settle the question in his mind as to whether it
was mortal or not.</p>
<p>The problem was quickly solved, for Inez was never
backward in asserting her individuality.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&#8220;How did I come here? That&#8217;s a great question
to ask! I got tired and lay down to sleep, and have
just woke up. I think this is a real nice boat. Are
you the captain? My name is Inez Hawthorne&ndash;&ndash;what
is yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>These questions, uttered with childish rapidity and
ingenuousness, threw some light upon the apparent
mystery.</p>
<p>&#8220;She belongs to the steamer,&#8221; said Abe Storms,
with his eyes fixed wonderingly upon her. &#8220;She has
managed to get in our boat in some way, and we have
carried her off. Did you ever see anything so pretty?&#8221;</p>
<p>As the reader has learned, there was good cause for
this admiring question. Both of the men were bachelors,
but they possessed natural refinement, and they
could reverence the innocence and loveliness of childhood.
With the discovery that she was an actual human
being, the awe-struck wonder of the two men
vanished, though their curiosity was great to learn
how it was she was carried away from the steamer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come here and talk with me?&#8221; asked
Storms, reaching out his arms invitingly, but a little
doubtful whether she would respond, though the
stoop-shouldered inventor was always popular with
children. The answer of Inez was a sudden spring,
which landed her plump into the lap of the mate,
while she flung her arms around his neck with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
merry laugh, and then wheeled about on his knee, so
that she could look in the face of either of the men,
who, not unnaturally, felt a strange and strong attraction
toward the beautiful child.</p>
<p>Then the two began a series of questions that were
answered in the characteristic fashion of childhood,
but from which the friends succeeded in extracting
something like a clear explanation of her presence on
board the <i>Coral</i>&ndash;&ndash;so many miles from the steamer on
which she had set sail at San Francisco.</p>
<p>They learned that Inez&ndash;&ndash;who was such a pet on
the <i>Polynesia</i> that she was allowed to do as she chose&ndash;&ndash;was
invited by one of the crew to visit the <i>Coral</i>,
while she lay so close to the disabled steamer. The
one who gave this invitation was Hyde Brazzier, and
he was struck with the wonderful loveliness of the
child, when she questioned him about the schooner.</p>
<p>There is no nature, however steeped in crime, in
which there is not a divine spark which may be fanned
into a flame&ndash;&ndash;which, perchance, may illumine the
whole soul; and but for the subsequent strange events,
little Inez Hawthorne might have proved, in the most
literal sense, a heaven-sent messenger upon that craft,
which carried so much wickedness in the forecastle.</p>
<p>Brazzier rowed the short intervening distance, and
then took the child by the hand and showed her
through the schooner, there being little to exhibit.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Finally she was led into the cabin, where she said she
was tired and wished to lie down. Thereupon Brazzier
lifted her upon the captain&#8217;s berth and drew the
coverlet over her. A minute later the weary eyes
closed in slumber and he left the cabin.</p>
<p>Brazzier had no intention, up to this time, of using
any deception in the matter; but, under the persuasion
of Redvignez, he gave way to the innate wickedness
of his nature, and chuckled over the lamentable
occurrence. They felt pleasure in the certainty that
what they were doing was sure to make other hearts
ache.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>&#8220;PORT YOUR HELM!&#8221;</h3>
</div>
<p>When a thorough search of the steamer <i>Polynesia</i>
made known the truth that little Inez Hawthorne was
nowhere upon it, the sorrowful conclusion was that
she had fallen overboard in some manner and been
drowned.</p>
<p>But the belief was scarcely formed, when the discovery
was made that such was not the case; that in
fact she had been taken away by the schooner <i>Coral</i>,
whose mate performed such good service in mending
the broken shaft of the <i>Polynesia</i>.</p>
<p>The story as told Captain Strathmore was as
follows:</p>
<p>The two officers of the schooner were rowed to the
steamer by one of the crew, who climbed up the ladder
at the side of the <i>Polynesia</i>, and spent a few minutes
in inspecting the broken shaft. He then came back.
His attention was attracted to little Inez, whose
childish curiosity was excited by the appearance of a
stranger who had but one eye, and who looked so different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
from the trim-looking members of the steamer&#8217;s
crew. The two fell into conversation, and Inez asked
so many questions about the schooner that the stranger
invited her to take a look at it. He was heard to say
that the captain and mate would be engaged for two or
three hours, and there would be plenty of time to row
the child over the intervening distance, explore the
<i>Coral</i>, and come back before Captain Bergen and his
mate would be ready to leave.</p>
<p>Naturally, Inez gladly accepted the invitation, and
the sinister-looking man, picking her up, carefully descended
the ladder to his small boat, and rowed away
to the schooner.</p>
<p>This story, it will be observed, corresponded with
that told by Brazzier himself.</p>
<p>No one thought anything of the proceeding, which
was one of the most natural in the world, and there
was nothing to arouse misgiving on the part of those
who witnessed it.</p>
<p>Inez was almost a spoiled child from the indulgence
shown her by every one with whom she came in contact.
She distrusted no one, because she had never
had any reason to do so. It was night when the officers
of the schooner were rowed back, and those who
had seen Inez taken away did not observe that the
boat returned without her. Holding no thought of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
anything wrong, they gave no further attention to the
strange sailor.</p>
<p>The moment Captain Strathmore learned these
facts, he caused an abrupt change to be made in the
course of the <i>Polynesia</i>. For he was determined that
no effort should be spared to recover the lost child,
who had so endeared herself to every one on board the
steamer.</p>
<p>The precise point where the accident had befallen
the shaft was recorded on the log, as a matter of
course, and it was within the power of the chief officer
to return wonderfully close to that spot. If the
schooner <i>Coral</i> should remain anywhere in that latitude
and longitude, she could be found and Inez
recovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not likely the schooner is near there,&#8221; reflected
Captain Strathmore, as he swept the horizon
with his glass and failed to catch sight of a sail.
&#8220;They could not have taken away the child ignorantly,
and instead of remaining there or attempting to find
us, the captain has headed in some direction which is
not the one he named, as if by accident, when he was
aboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain was in that mood that it would have
been dangerous for him to come upon the daring
thieves. He could conceive of no explanation that
would relieve them from his wrath, and as the steamer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
described a huge curve in the sea and headed toward
the point where he hoped to gain sight of the sail, full
steam was put on, and she ran at a rate of speed
which, in the condition of her shaft, was certainly
dangerous to a high degree.</p>
<p>It may be said there was not a heart on board the
<i>Polynesia</i> that did not share in the general anxiety,
and there was scarcely an eye that did not scan the
broad ocean again and again in the hope of catching
sight of the schooner.</p>
<p>Several sails were descried in the course of the day,
but not one was that of the <i>Coral</i>, and when the night
descended not only had there been a complete failure,
but the captain was convinced that it was useless for
him to delay the steamer by hunting further.</p>
<p>With an angry and sad heart he gave over the
search, and the <i>Polynesia</i> was headed once more toward
the far-off imperial Japanese city of Tokio.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would give a thousand dollars to know what it
all means,&#8221; said Captain Strathmore, as he stood on
the bridge debating the matter with himself. &#8220;There
is something about the whole business which I don&#8217;t
understand. In the first place, Inez came under my
charge in an extraordinary way. I don&#8217;t believe that
that man who brought her down to the wharf told the
truth, and I very much doubt whether the parents of
the little one have ever been in Japan. She may have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
been stolen from some one, and this means has been
resorted to in order to get her out of the way. I wish
I had questioned her more closely,&#8221; continued the
perplexed captain, following up the train of thought,
&#8220;for she let drop an expression or two now and then
that showed she had some remembrances which it
would have been interesting to call up. It&#8217;s too late
now,&#8221; added the old sailor, with a sigh, &#8220;and probably
I shall never see her again. She had nestled down
into that spot in my heart which was left vacant many
weary years ago, when my own Inez died and my only
boy became as one dead, and there is no sacrifice I
would not make would it but bring this one back to
me. It is curious, but the feeling is strong upon me
that somewhere at some time we shall meet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Port your helm!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the startling order which the quartermaster
sent to the wheel-house at that moment, and which
was obeyed with as much promptness as is possible
on such a gigantic craft as an ocean steamer.</p>
<p>The night, for a rarity, was dark and misty, a peculiar
fog resting upon the water, and shutting out
the view in every direction. It would seem that there
could be little danger of a collision on the broad bosom
of the mightiest ocean of the globe, but there must always
be a certain ratio of danger, and none realized
this more than Captain Strathmore.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>The <i>Polynesia</i> had been running at half speed ever
since the sun went down, and her whistle blew at
irregular intervals. At the moment the startling order
was communicated to the man at the wheel, the
lights of another steamer were discerned directly
ahead. And these were scarcely observed when the
mountainous hull loomed up to view in appalling
proximity, and a cold shudder ran through every officer
and sailor at the sight, for there was just a single
second or two when it seemed certain that the two
crafts would come together with an earthquake shock
and such an irresistible momentum as would crash
the two prodigious hulls to splinters, and send the
crews and passengers to join the multitudes who have
gone before them to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Signals and commands were rapidly exchanged, and
the slight misunderstanding which existed between the
two steamers at first was quickly removed. The
shouts and orders, the tinkling of the engineer&#8217;s bell,
and even the sound of hurrying feet, were heard on
one ship as distinctly as on the other.</p>
<p>Most fortunately the officers of each were sensible
men, who enforced discipline, and who, therefore, did
not lose their heads when sudden peril came upon
them.</p>
<p>There was desperate need of haste on the part of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
all, but the haste was intelligent, and something was
accomplished.</p>
<p>The stranger instantly reversed her screw, while the
<i>Polynesia</i> was equally prompt in her backward movement.
They escaped by a chance so narrow that it
was terrifying. The bow of the <i>Polynesia</i> grazed the
side of the stranger as they passed upon their diagonal
courses, and every one on the two ships who understood
the dreadful peril drew a deep breath and uttered
a prayer of thankfulness when it swept by, and
the two steamers vanished from each other&#8217;s sight in
the misty darkness.</p>
<p>The engineer of the <i>Polynesia</i> was signaled to go
forward again, and the screw was started; but, if the
one who uttered the order had forgotten the contingency
against which they had been warned, the one
who executed that order had not, and he gave the engine
just enough steam to start the shaft.</p>
<p>As he did so, listening intently the meanwhile, he
heard an ominous crunching, grinding and jarring
in the after hold, and he knew too well what it meant.
He instantly shut off steam, and with the captain
hastened to make the investigation. As they feared,
the broken shaft had been wrenched apart again, and
it looked as if it were injured beyond repair.</p>
<p>But what man has done, man can do, and the ingenious
recourse of Abe Storms was resorted to again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
With great care the fractured pieces were reunited
and bound, but the task was, in reality, harder than
before, since the terrific grinding and wrenching to
which it had been subjected broke off much of the corrugated
surface.</p>
<p>The work was completed after many long hours of
hard work, and once more the <i>Polynesia</i> started slowly
under steam for the strange island-empire of Asia.
This unexpected delay, as the reader will see, doubtless
had much to do with the failure of the schooner
to find the steamer, since it threw out all possibility of
calculating where the larger craft could be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if we have no more vessels trying to run into
us,&#8221; muttered the captain, as he resumed his place on
the bridge, &#8220;we stand a chance of reaching Japan
after all, without calling on our sails to help us.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, standing at his post, with everything going
well, his thoughts naturally reverted to the strange
mischance by which little Inez Hawthorne was lost to
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe Captain Bergen or his mate, Abe
Storms, would knowingly take off the child in that
fashion, though the girl was enough to tempt any one
to steal her. There is something about the whole business
which I don&#8217;t understand. We ought to have
found each other, though, if he is still hunting for me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
This second breakage of the shaft will tend to keep us
apart.&#8221;</p>
<p>The long voyage of the steamer to Japan terminated
without any incident worth the recording, and Captain
Strathmore naturally became anxious to meet the
parents of Inez, though sorrowing very much over the
story he would be forced to tell them. But no one
appeared at Tokio to claim the child, and the wondering
captain proceeded to make inquiries.</p>
<p>It was easy to obtain from the church authorities
a list of the names of the Christian missionaries in
Japan, and they were scanned carefully by the captain,
who was given such assistance by the officials
themselves that there could be no mistake. Among
them was no one by the name of Hawthorne. It was
plain then that deception had been used when the man
in San Francisco declared that the parents of Inez
were missionaries in Japan.</p>
<p>As day after day passed and the steamer <i>Polynesia</i>
was gradually prepared for her return voyage to California,
there was one strong, harrowing conviction
which forced itself upon the distressed captain:</p>
<p>&#8220;Had Inez not been stolen from the steamer, no one
would have come to claim her, and she would have
been mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>His heart thrilled at the thought of how close he
had come to obtaining such a priceless prize for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
possession, and then he added, as if to cheer himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind; the earth is far and wide. She is
alive somewhere upon its face, and at some time, at
heaven&#8217;s own pleasure, she and I shall meet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brave and rugged Captain Strathmore! Was the
spirit of prophecy upon you when you muttered the
cheering words?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE REASON WHY THE VOYAGE WAS UNDERTAKEN</h3>
</div>
<p>At this point it is necessary that the reader should
be made acquainted with what has been only hinted
up to this point. We mean the reason why it was that
the little schooner <i>Coral</i>, under the charge of Captain
Bergen and Abram Storms, the mate, was on the Pacific
Ocean, voyaging toward the South Seas.</p>
<p>The skipper was fond of telling the strange story,
and the mate heard it many times, as repeated to him
one stormy night, around the roaring fire of Captain
Bergen&#8217;s hearthstone in New England. It ran thus:</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, Abe, I was going down Washington
Street, in Boston, one day, when I came upon a
drunken sailor, who was suffering a terrible beating
at the hands of a couple of land-sharks, that were
were evidently determined to rob him, if they had
not already done so.</p>
<p>&#8220;It r&#8217;iled my blood to see such scandalous proceedings
going on, and I sailed in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I helped pick up Jack tar, and he was taken
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
to the hospital, where his wounds were found to be of
a dangerous nature. His assailants were so badly
hurt that they went to the hospital, and when they
came out they were shifted to the penitentiary, where
they&#8217;re likely to stay for a good many years to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having taken the part of Bill Grebbens, as he told
me his name was, I called at the hospital to see him
every day, for I wasn&#8217;t busy just then. The poor fellow
was very grateful for the service I had done him,
though sad to say I was too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bill had been on such a terrible spree that his system
wasn&#8217;t in condition to resist disease, and before
long it was plain he was going to make a die of it.
He was a plucky fellow, and when the doctor told him
he had to go, he didn&#8217;t weaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just before he died, he took me by the hand, and
told me he hadn&#8217;t a living relative in the world, nor
one who had been such a friend to him as I had proved
to be. By that time my own eyes were getting misty,
and I begged him to say nothing about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him I would see that he had a decent burial,
and would attend to anything he wanted me to do. He
said there wasn&#8217;t anything, for it could make no difference
to him what became of his body after his
death, and for his part he would as lief the doctors
should have it.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, he took this paper from under his pillow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
and showed it to me, and told me all about it. I
thought at first his mind was wandering, but I soon
saw that his head was level, and he knew what he was
talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>The paper which Captain Bergen produced at this
point of his narrative was covered with some well-executed
drawings, which, having been done by the
sailor himself, showed that he was a man of education.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those dots there represent the King George
Islands of the South Pacific, lying in about fifteen
degrees south latitude and one hundred and forty-three
degrees west longitude. To the north here is
Mendina Archipelago, and here to the east are the
Paumotu Islands, sometimes known as the Pearl
Islands. There are a good many of them, and away
to the northeast of the group is another island, which,
although much the larger on the map, is really a small
coral island, with a lagoon, and so unimportant that
it has no name, and cannot be found on any map I
ever saw.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will observe the figure and directions marked
on this paper,&#8221; added Captain Bergen, who invariably
became excited at this point in his narration, &#8220;which,
with his explanations, are so easily understood that
no one can go astray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Bill Grebbens once belonged to a party of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
mutineers of a British vessel, who found it growing so
hot for them that they put in to this island, scuttled
and sunk their ship, and lived there two years. It was
uninhabited, and they led a lazy, vagabond life in
that charming climate till a strange sort of sickness
broke out among them and carried off eight, leaving
only Grebbens and a single shipmate.</p>
<p>&#8220;These two spent several months longer in wandering
about the island looking for and yet dreading to
see a sail, when one day they discovered a bed of
pearl-oysters, which they examined and found to be of
surpassing richness. The majority of the shells contained
pearls, many of them of great size, and the two
men saw that an immense fortune lay only a few
fathoms under the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;They instantly set to work with great eagerness;
but it is seldom that a man obtains wealth in this
world by walking over a path of roses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Within the first half-hour, a huge man-eating
shark glided into the clear water, and with one snap of
his enormous jaws actually bit the body of the other
sailor in two. The horrified Grebbens managed to get
out just in time to save himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;He had enough of pearl-diving, and he shudderingly
turned his back upon the spot, and began looking
out to sea again for a sail, determined now to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
leave, no matter if he should be carried to England
and executed.</p>
<p>&#8220;He managed to set up the topmast of the wreck,
and to catch the attention of a whaler a few days
later, and was taken off. Before going, however, he
made a careful drawing of the place, and by studying
other charts on the American whaler which took him
away he was able to locate the island with such correctness
that he could return to it at any time, his intention,
of course, being to do so at some period when
he could go provided with means to prosecute his
search without such frightful risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Bill never saw the time, for he was too fond
of liquor when ashore. He met his death just as I
told you, and he gave me this chart or map of the
locality, telling me that a fortune lay at that point
where my finger is resting to whosoever should go
after it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such was the story of Captain Bergen, as he related
it to his friend, Abe Storms, to whom he proposed
that they should fit out an expedition to go to
the South Seas in quest of the fortune that awaited
them in the shape of pearls.</p>
<p>Abe was slower and more deliberate, but he finally
fell in with the scheme, and the two, as we have already
stated, became joint partners in the grand
enterprise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>Both were frugal men, and they now decided to invest
all their funds in the scheme, which promised to
make or break them. Instead of sailing from the port
of Boston, they took an important cut &#8220;across lots&#8221; by
going by rail to San Francisco, thus saving the longest
and most dangerous portion of the voyage, which
otherwise would be necessary. In San Francisco, at
a sale of bankrupt property, they bought the schooner,
which has already been described, and shipped their
crew.</p>
<p>The wonder was that two men possessing the
shrewdness of Storms and Bergen should have been
so deceived respecting their men.</p>
<p>Hyde Brazzier was an American sailor, with
blotched, bleared face, with one eye gone, while over
the sunken, sightless cavity he wore a green patch, his
face covered by a scraggly beard, and his single eye,
small and deep-set, added to the sinister expression of
his countenance.</p>
<p>He had the reputation of being a good seaman, and
undoubtedly he was, and being strong and vigorous,
in the prime of life, he was considered an especially
valuable man to Captain Bergen, who paid him five
dollars more per month than he expected.</p>
<p>Since Captain Bergen had pursued a rather original
course from the beginning, he continued to do so.
He engaged his men without any help from the shipping-master,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and had hardly reached an understanding
with the American when Alfredo Redvignez put
in an appearance and applied for a berth, saying that
he had heard the best kinds of accounts of the captain&#8217;s
seamanship and humanity&ndash;&ndash;even in far-away
Boston.</p>
<p>Redvig&ndash;&ndash;so called for convenience&ndash;&ndash;said that he
had been employed in the East India trade, and was
a sailor of nearly twenty years&#8217; experience. It struck
both Captain Bergen and Mate Storms that, as they
were going to the tropics, he was likely to prove a useful
man, and he was engaged.</p>
<p>The captain ventured to ask Brazzier&#8217;s opinion of
the other sailor, but the American said he had never
heard of him before&ndash;&ndash;though he liked the cut of his
jib, and was glad he had been hired. But had any one
been watching the faces of the American and Spaniard,
he would have detected several suspicious signals
which passed between them; and this, added to the
fact that, in a very short time, they became intimately
acquainted, as may be said, looked as if there had been
deception on that point.</p>
<p>The fact was, the two had arranged the matter beforehand,
so as to go together in this business&ndash;&ndash;somewhat
on the same principle that their employers entered
into partnership. They were both serving under
assumed names, and were obliged to take no little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
precaution to keep their identity concealed, for they
were &#8220;wanted&#8221; for serious crimes in more than one
port.</p>
<p>Redvig was a small, swarthy, muscular man, with
coal-black, curling hair, short, curly beard and mustache,
black eyes, with an aquiline nose, and both he
and Brazzier had a fashion of wearing small gold
ear-rings. Their arms and breast were plentifully
tattooed, so that but for the great exception of their
evil dispositions, they might well have passed for good
specimens of the proverbial Jack tar.</p>
<p>It was different with the huge colored man, Pomp
Cooper, who had been known about the wharves of
San Francisco for a number of years. He was jolly
and good-natured, possessed of prodigious strength,
and had been on shipboard enough to acquire a fair
knowledge of navigating a coasting vessel.</p>
<p>While many believed he possessed the proverbial
loyalty of his race, and could not be induced to commit
any grave crime, yet it must be admitted that
there were ugly rumors afloat concerning him. It
was asserted by more than one that he was a river and
harbor pirate, and belonged to one of the worst gangs
that ever infested the harbor of San Francisco.</p>
<p>While Captain Bergen was not ignorant of these
rumors, yet he placed no credence in them, and believed
Pomp to be one of the most valuable men he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
could obtain. Such in brief was the crew of the
<i>Coral</i>, when she sailed on her long voyage to the South
Seas, in quest of pearls&ndash;&ndash;the location of which had
been given by the dying sailor in the Boston hospital.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>VOYAGING SOUTHWARD</h3>
</div>
<p>It was certainly very wonderful that little Inez
Hawthorne should have been transferred from the
steamer to the schooner, and that many hours should
have passed before the discovery was made by the
respective captains of the craft.</p>
<p>Yet such was the fact, and Captain Bergen and
Mate Storms had no sooner learned the real situation
than Hyde Brazzier was sent for to tell how it occurred.
As he was the one who rowed the small boat,
there could be no doubt that he knew. The story he
told was the true one, with the exception of the supplement&ndash;&ndash;that
he actually forgot about the little girl
after she went into the cabin and fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was impossible, it may be said, that such could
be the fact, and the officers looked knowingly at each
other. They knew he was falsifying, but they made
no comment, except to declare that she must be taken
back to the steamer without an hour&#8217;s delay.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen learned from Inez that she had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
relatives on board the steamer, and she did not show
any special distress over being where she was. But,
for all that, the honest New Englander felt that she
should be restored, and he immediately took every
means for doing so.</p>
<p>His supposition was that she would be speedily
missed from the <i>Polynesia</i>, which would at once make
search for the schooner. Accordingly, the <i>Coral</i> was
headed northwest, under all sail, the sun just rising
at the time this change of course was made.</p>
<p>&#8220;The steamer will go so much faster than we,&#8221; said
the captain, &#8220;that there is no possibility of overhauling
her, unless her shaft should give out again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no danger of that. More likely she&#8217;ll
turn about and look for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the sun climbed the heavens, the horizon was
anxiously scanned for some point where the black column
of a steamer&#8217;s smokestack could be seen staining
the clear sky. Far away to the northward, a vapor
was observed, which at first was set down as the sight
for which they were searching; but it was soon learned
that it was a peculiarly-formed cloud, resting almost
upon the water.</p>
<p>The upper rigging and sails of possibly an American
whaler were descried a long distance to the northward,
and a full-rigged ship was detected closer in,
and further to the eastward. But no sign of the <i>Polynesia</i>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
was discovered through the powerful binocular
glasses with which Captain Bergen swept the horizon.
There was strong hope, in spite of this, that she would
be seen before sunset, and the <i>Coral</i> held to her course
toward the southwest, not only for that day and night,
but for the two succeeding ones. But it is useless to
dwell upon the search made by the smaller vessel,
which was without the faintest glimmer of success.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen and Mate Storms did their utmost
to undo the wrong act of their sailors, but at the end
of the third day they held an anxious consultation as
to what was the right course left to pursue. They
had given up hope of meeting the <i>Polynesia</i> except
by chasing her all the way to Japan, they having
learned that Tokio was her destination.</p>
<p>Should the <i>Coral</i> follow her there, or first fulfil its
own destiny in the Paumotu Islands? This was the
all-important matter to be settled.</p>
<p>When a man makes a great invention or discovery,
his first dread is that some one else will anticipate him
and gather to himself all the glory and profit. This
had been a constant fear in the case of the captain
and mate of the schooner <i>Coral</i> ever since they began
their preparations for the journey to the South Seas.
It cost them a pang of dread when, therefore, they
headed the schooner about in the hunt for the steamer,
for, as will be readily understood, the apprehension of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
which we have spoken intensifies the nearer one gets
to the goal.</p>
<p>There were other considerations which entered into
the question as to whether they should go on or turn
about. Inez Hawthorne had, as might have been expected,
adapted herself to her new position as passenger
on the schooner, and ran hither and thither at
will, just as she did on the <i>Polynesia</i>, and she climbed
all over the captain and mate, as if they were Captain
Strathmore and his officer, or some of the passengers.</p>
<p>She occasionally expressed a longing to see the
grizzled old sea-captain, whom she called her second,
or new &#8220;papa,&#8221; but there was no one else for whom
she particularly longed. Her affection was distributed
so equally and spontaneously that among several
hundred it could not be very profound. Only in the
case of the brave old Captain Strathmore was it deep
and steadfast.</p>
<p>It would delay the voyage to the Pearl Islands not
for weeks, but for months, to sail away to Asia, and
then turn about and put back to the southern seas,
and during that interval what might not take place?
What assurance could there be that the precious pearl-bed
would not be devastated?</p>
<p>With the plans which Abe Storms had perfected
on the way from home, it was believed that a week&#8217;s
time after their arrival at their destination would be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
sufficient to make them enormously wealthy, and thus
the voyage which they would afterward take to Japan
would be delayed only a month or two, perhaps. Furthermore,
the parents and friends of Inez would
have every reason to believe she was in safe hands,
and would soon be restored to them. All these were
weighty considerations, it must be confessed, and they
decided the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have done all that can be done,&#8221; said Captain
Bergen, standing at the stern with his hand upon
the wheel, while Abe Storms, thoughtfully smoking
his pipe, was at his elbow, with his arms folded and
his eyes gazing dreamily toward the western horizon,
where the sun was about to dip into the ocean.</p>
<p>&#8220;I agree with you,&#8221; was the reply of his mate, who
was as conscientious in everything he did as was the
captain. &#8220;I consider that the chance is as one in a
thousand that we shall meet the steamer this side of
Tokio, and if we undertake to follow, we shall lose
several months of most precious time, without accomplishing
any commensurate good. The child is contented
and happy here.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if to emphasize this assertion, the laugh of Inez
was heard at that moment as she came bounding up
the steps of the cabin, and ran toward the bow, where
the giant negro, Pomp, was leaning against the gunwale,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
his arms also folded, and an expression of contentment
upon his broad, shiny countenance.</p>
<p>The instant he caught sight of Inez his face lighted
up and his white, even teeth were displayed with
pleasure, as she ran toward him.</p>
<p>It was singular, indeed, that, ever since her first
awaking on board the <i>Coral</i>, Inez had shown not a
positive dislike of Redvig and Brazzier, but what may
be called a lack of friendship toward them. She was
trusting and loving to Pomp and the two officers, but
it was evident that she avoided the others. Possibly
she could not have told the reason had she tried, and
it is equally possible that she was not aware of it herself.
But every one else on board saw it plainly.</p>
<p>When two men in authority talk as did the captain
and mate of the schooner <i>Coral</i>, the conclusion is inevitable.
The decision was made to go on to the Paumotu
Islands, after which the voyage would be made
to Japan, and, alas! that it was so.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>GROPING IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>
<p>Life on board the schooner <i>Coral</i>, bound for the
South Seas, now became like one delightful dream.</p>
<p>The sails, fanned by the steady trade-wind, hardly
ever required attention, since the course of the craft
never varied more than a few points for days at a
time, and whoever it was at the wheel, he might as
well have lashed it fast and gone to sleep, for all the
necessity there was of keeping awake.</p>
<p>There had been some elemental disturbances which
required seamanship to weather, but nothing like that
usually encountered in the Atlantic. But there came
a long spell of weather, faultless in every respect, and
whose only drawback was the dread that each day
would be the last of such delight. The sun rose clear
and bright, and at high noon, as they approached the
equator, it was sometimes hot, but the breeze which
continually swept the deck tempered it to the crew
and passenger. Had they been caught in a calm the
heat would have been suffocating; but Providence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
favored them, and they sped along like a seagull toward
their destination. There seemed to be times
when the green surface of the sea was at perfect rest;
but the regular rising and sinking of the <i>Coral</i> showed
that the bosom of the great deep was heaving as it always
does, though the long swells came only at extended
intervals.</p>
<p>The water was of crystalline clearness, and, looking
over the gunwale, one could see far into the depths,
where strange-looking fish were sporting, sometimes
coming to the surface and then shooting far down beyond
the reach of human vision. Now and then, too,
as little Inez leaned over the side of the vessel and
peered downward, she caught sight of something like
a shadow, gliding hither and thither, apparently without
the slightest effort to keep pace with the schooner,
which was bowling along at a rapid rate. It was one
of those monstrous sharks, that will snap a man in
two as quickly as if he were but an apple, should he
fall overboard.</p>
<p>Not a day passed without descrying one or more
sails at varying distances, but our friends did not hail
or approach any. Both Captain Bergen and Mate
Storms were in a nervous condition, and were morbidly
apprehensive of being anticipated by some one
in dredging for the invaluable pearl-oysters. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
were afraid their errand would be suspected, or they
would be attacked after they should secure their prize.</p>
<p>One day, under the pretense of wanting medicine,
Hyde Brazzier suddenly appeared at the cabin door.
The mate and captain were, as usual, studying the
chart, and while the mate was ransacking the medicine
chest for the drug, that single eye of the sailor
secured five minutes&#8217; sharp scrutiny of the all-important
map.</p>
<p>Redvignez and Brazzier were not much together,
as a matter of course, for one was in the captain&#8217;s
watch and the other in the mate&#8217;s, but during the
long, pleasant days and nights when they were voyaging
toward the South Seas, they obtained many
opportunities for confidential talks. All this might
have been in the natural order of things on board the
schooner, where the discipline was not strict, but Abe
Storms had become pretty well satisfied that harm
was meant, and mischief was brewing. He saw it in
the looks and manner of these two men, who, while
they were watching others, did not suspect they were
watched in turn.</p>
<p>About Pomp he was not so certain. The steward
and cook seemed to be on good terms with the two
sailors, and he frequently sat with them as they
formed a little group forward, on the bright moonlight
nights, when they preferred to sit thus and smoke
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
and spin yarns to going below and catching slumber,
when it was their privilege to do so.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe he is in with them,&#8221; was the conclusion
which Storms, the mate, finally reached, after watching
and listening as best he could for several days.
&#8220;They&#8217;re hatching some conspiracy&ndash;&ndash;most likely a
mutiny to take possession of the ship. Captain Bergen
doesn&#8217;t suspect it&ndash;&ndash;he is so absorbed in the pearl
business; and I&#8217;ll let him alone for the present,
though it may be best to give him a hint or two to
keep him on his guard.&#8221;</p>
<p>It never can be known what the restraining power
of little Inez Hawthorne was on board that vessel on
her extraordinary voyage to the Paumotu Islands, in
the South Seas. She lived over again the same life
that was hers during the few days spent on the <i>Polynesia</i>.
She ran hither and thither, climbing into dangerous
places at times, but with such grace and command
of her limbs that she never once fell or even lost
her balance. She chatted and laughed with Brazzier
and Redvig, but she preferred the others, and showed
it so plainly in her manner, that, unfortunately, the
two could not avoid noticing it.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; said Captain Bergen, one evening while
sitting in the cabin with the child on his knee, &#8220;I want
you to try and think hard and answer me all the questions
I ask you. Will you?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will, if you don&#8217;t ask too hard ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will be easy as I can. You have told me
all about the big steamer that you were on when we
found you, and you said that you lived with your
Uncle Con in San Francisco, and that it was he and
your Aunt Jemima that put you on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say any such thing!&#8221; indignantly protested
Inez. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t got any Aunt Jemima&ndash;&ndash;it
was my Aunt Letitia.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain and mate smiled, for a little piece of
strategy had succeeded. They had never before got
the girl to give the name of her aunt, though she
mentioned that of her uncle. But she now spoke it,
her memory refreshed by the slight teasing to which
she was subjected.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very good. I&#8217;m glad to learn that your
uncle and aunt had two such pretty names as Con and
Letitia Bumblebee.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t you ashamed of yourself?&#8221; demanded Inez,
turning upon him with flashing eyes. &#8220;I never heard
of such a funny name as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg pardon. What, then, is their name?&#8221;</p>
<p>The little head was bent and the fair brow wrinkled
with thought. She had tried the same thing before,
though it must be believed that she could not have
tried very hard, or she would not have failed to remember
the name of those with whom she lived but a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
short time before. But she used her brain to its utmost
now, and it did not take her long to solve the
question. In a few seconds she looked up and laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I know their name. It was Hermann,
though he sometimes called himself George Smith.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The other sounds German,&#8221; remarked Storms, in
a lower voice. &#8220;Go ahead and get all you can from
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long did you live with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; said Inez, as she turned her lustrous
blue eyes toward the roof of the cabin, as if she expected
to read the answer there. &#8220;I guess it was about
two&ndash;&ndash;three hundred years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was in earnest, and Storms observed:</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be a little off on that; but take another
tack.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember living with any one excepting
your Uncle George and Aunt Letitia?&#8221;</p>
<p>Inez thought hard again, and replied, after a few
seconds:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Sometimes he was Uncle George
and sometimes Uncle Con. We lived in the city a
good while, where there were, oh, such lots of houses!
but there was a time before that when we come such
a long, long way in the cars. We rode and rode, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
I guess we must have come from the moon, for we was
ten years on the road.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember what sort of looking place the
moon was?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just like San Francisco&ndash;&ndash;that is, it was
full of houses.&#8221;</p>
<p>The officers looked at each other with a smile, and
the mate said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s plain enough what that means. She has come
from New York, over the Union Pacific, and her trip
was probably the longest of her life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember your father and mother?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Inez, with a look of perplexity
on her young face which it was not pleasant to see.
&#8220;Sometimes I remember or dream of them, before we
took such a long ride on the cars. My mother used to
hold me on her lap and kiss me, and so did my father,
and then there was crying, and something dreadful
happened in the house, and then I can&#8217;t remember
anything more until I was on the cars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be all right,&#8221; said Captain Bergen to his
mate, &#8220;for this could occur without anything being
amiss.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible; but I have a conviction that there is
something wrong about the whole business. I believe,
in short, that the person who placed her on board
the steamer <i>Polynesia</i> had no claim upon her at all.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That, in fact, the man stole her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it, exactly; and still further, I don&#8217;t believe
she has any father or mother in Japan, and that
if we had gone thither we should have lost all the time
and accomplished nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be, Abe, that you are right,&#8221; said the
captain, who held a great admiration for his mate,
&#8220;but I must say you can build a fraud and conspiracy
on the smallest foundation of any man I ever knew.
But, Abe, you may be right, I say, and if you are,
it&#8217;s just as well that we didn&#8217;t go on a fool&#8217;s errand
to Tokio, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth will soon be known, captain.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE MUTINEERS</h3>
</div>
<p>A few degrees south of the equator, the schooner
<i>Coral</i> ran into a tempest of such fury that with all
the skilful seamanship of her captain and crew, and
the admirable qualities of the schooner itself, she narrowly
escaped foundering.</p>
<p>There were two days when she was in such imminent
peril that not an eye was closed in slumber, excepting
in the case of little Inez Hawthorne, who felt
the situation only to the extent that it compelled her
to stay close in the cabin, while the vessel pitched and
tossed from the crest of one tremendous billow, down,
seemingly, into the fathomless depths between, and
then laboriously climbed the mountain in front, with
the spray and mist whirling about the deck and rigging
like millions of fine shot. But the gallant <i>Coral</i>
rode it out safely, and the steady breeze caught her
and she sped swiftly in the direction of the Pearl
Islands.</p>
<p>The little girl had run hither and thither, until,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
tired out, she had flung herself upon the berth in the
cabin, where she was sleeping soundly, while the captain
was doing the same; Abe Storms, the mate, being
on deck at the wheel. It was yet early in the evening,
and Hyde Brazzier and Alfredo Redvignez were sitting
close together, forward, smoking their pipes and
conversing in low tones. The breeze was almost directly
abeam, so that the sails carried the craft along
at a rapid rate, the water foaming and curling from
the bow, while the rising and sinking of the schooner
on the enormous swells were at such long intervals as
almost to be imperceptible. As far as the eye could
extend in every direction, no glimpse of a sail or light
could be perceived, nor had any been observed through
the day, which confirmed what Bill Grebbens, the
sailor in the Boston hospital, said, to the effect that,
despite the location of the Paumotu Islands, the approach
to them from the direction of California took
one in a section where the sails of commerce were
rarely seen.</p>
<p>The captain and mate had been consulting their
chart, and had taken their reckoning more frequently
and with greater care than ever before. The conclusion
at which they arrived was that they were already
south of the northernmost island of the Paumotu
group, and were close to the Coral Island, along
whose shore were to be found the precious pearls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
which were to make them all, or rather the two,
wealthy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a curious business,&#8221; reflected Abe Storms,
while holding the wheel motionless. &#8220;When I consider
the matter fairly, I don&#8217;t see why the expedition
should not succeed. But it is so different from the
coasting business, in which the captain and I have
been engaged for years, that it is hard to believe
we&#8217;re going to make anything out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He listened a minute to the murmur of the voices
forward, and then he added, pursuing the same train
of thought:</p>
<p>&#8220;What an extraordinary thing it is that we should
have this little girl for a passenger! Suppose we
carry her back to Tokio after this pearl hunt, and fail
to find her parents?&#8221;</p>
<p>He took but a minute to consider the question,
when he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;It can never make any difference to Inez herself,
for her sweet face and winning ways will secure her
a welcome and a home in a hundred different places.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the mate was indulging in these fancies and
reveries, Brazzier and Redvignez were holding an important
conference forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we won&#8217;t have much further to sail,&#8221; observed
the Spaniard, with a slightly broken accent.
&#8220;We&#8217;re in the latitude of the Paumotus.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been there?&#8221; asked his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; but I know something about them, and then
you had a glimpse of the chart, which they&#8217;re continually
looking at, and I&#8217;m certain from what you said
that the particular spot we&#8217;re after isn&#8217;t far off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I conclude you&#8217;re right, more from the way they&#8217;re
acting than anything else. I wish I could get hold of
that chart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What would you do?&#8221; asked Redvignez, with a
significant side-glance at his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;What would I do? Why, I wouldn&#8217;t wait&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see as it will make much difference,&#8221; said
the other, in the most matter-of-fact voice, as he
coolly puffed his pipe. &#8220;We might as well take them
there and make sure of the spot, before we knock them
in the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>Brazzier gave a contemptuous sniff and a vicious
puff of his pipe, and remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever see two such fools, Redvig?&#8221; He
continued, with mock solemnity: &#8220;Beware of the
temptations of wealth. Behold those two specimens,
who have come all the way from Boston to fish for
pearls in the Paumotu Islands. Some old sailor had
the secret, and told the captain about it, and he has
told his friend, and they have formed a partnership
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
and hired us to go with them to dredge up the
oysters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is there so foolish in all that?&#8221; asked the
Spaniard, with a grin, which showed his white teeth
in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing; for you or I would have done the same
had we been placed in their shoes. But we would
have shown more sense than they. They believe we do
not suspect what their business is; and yet we both
understand the whole thing. Here we are within a
few hours&#8217; sail of the spot, and what&#8217;s to be done?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Spaniard indulged in a light laugh, and
replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;To think that we should consent to take twenty-five
dollars a month, while they scooped in their thousands&ndash;&ndash;their
millions&ndash;&ndash;it strikes me sometimes as the
greatest joke I ever heard. But, Brazzier, the best
plan is for us to be good boys, and go on to the island
and help take up the pearls; for then we shall be sure
of the right spot, and there shall be no mistake;
whereas, if we should take possession now, we might
miss the place, even with the help of the chart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what you&#8217;re right, Redvig,
though it galls me to wait. You know a lot of us took
charge of the <i>Spitfire</i>, and set the captain and first-mate
adrift, off Valparaiso. You were in favor of
waiting, and it was well if we had done so, for we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
came nearer running our necks into the halter that
time than we ever did since, and there wasn&#8217;t anything
aboard the old hulk that was worth the saving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about Pomp?&#8221; asked Redvig, in a
half-whisper, and with an accent which showed that
he considered the question of the highest importance.
&#8220;Is he all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t have any fear about him. I had a
long talk with him last night, and we shook hands on
the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>The negro was an important factor in this business,
for, a giant in stature and strength, whichever side he
precipitated himself and his prowess upon was sure to
win&ndash;&ndash;judging from the ordinary human standpoint.</p>
<p>Pomp, as we have hinted further back, was not an
African with a perfectly clear record. The rumors
about his belonging to a gang of river pirates in San
Francisco were correct, and he had been engaged in
some deeds which were of a character that the law
puts the severest ban upon. He was known to be daring,
and possessed such prodigious power, united to
activity, that, beyond a doubt, if he were placed upon
an even footing, he could have conquered the captain,
mate and the two sailors, without any special effort
upon his own part.</p>
<p>The importance of his declaring himself can therefore
be understood. He was a far better man than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
either of the two Caucasians, who hesitated about
approaching him. As it had to be done, however, the
matter was skilfully broached, after they had left San
Francisco and were sailing southward.</p>
<p>It was agreed by the two mutineers that, if the negro
held off, he was to be gotten rid of by some treachery,
though it was such a serious matter that they hesitated
long as to how it could be safely accomplished.
To their surprise and delight, however, Pomp listened
eagerly to the project and expressed his willingness to
go into it, though he insisted there should be no murdering
done, as he was not base enough at heart to
wish the death of either of the officers.</p>
<p>Brazzier consented; but in doing so he deceived the
negro. A mutiny, such as he contemplated, could
never be carried to a successful conclusion without
disposing finally and forever of the two officers themselves.
If they should be spared, the mutineers would
never be safe. But Pomp was misled from the first,
because it was believed he could be won over before
the time came to strike the blow. Redvignez set himself
very skilfully to do so, for Pomp was ignorant
and exceedingly greedy for wealth. Redvignez began
by telling him of a large number of fictitious mutinies,
in which the mutineers had made their fortunes
and lived happy and respected afterwards, and the
narrator made certain to impress upon the African
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
the fact that the job was rendered a perfect one by
following out the proverb that dead men tell no tales.
Then he incidentally mentioned others in which the
mutineers came to grief, all from the fact that they
allowed themselves to be controlled by a foolish sentiment
of mercy. The evil seed thus sown did not fail
to take root and bring forth its fruit, just as the sower
intended.</p>
<p>These little incidents were multiplied, and by-and-by
Pomp was told that there was but one way in
which to secure the enormous riches that lay in the
little bay in the South Seas, awaiting their coming,
and that was by making themselves complete masters
of the situation. The negro could not mistake the
meaning of this, and, after a feeble opposition, he
gave his assent, and said he would help carry out the
terrible programme, as it had been arranged from the
first.</p>
<p>It was certainly very curious how the coming of little
Inez Hawthorne upon the ship threatened for
awhile to disarrange every plan; but so it was. There
was a time when the better nature of the two evil men
asserted itself, and they began to consider the question
in the light of their awakened consciences; but these
divine monitors were only roused into temporary
wakefulness and speedily dropped asleep again. The
manifest distrust which Inez showed toward them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
seemed to fill their hearts with the most atrocious feelings,
and neither of them would have hesitated to
fling her overboard, had the opportunity been given.
Incredible as it may seem, it is the fact that they
would have preferred to do so, being restrained by
the simple question of policy. They saw that Pomp
had grown very fond of her, and any such action on
their part might alienate him&ndash;&ndash;a catastrophe which
they were anxious to avert above everything else.</p>
<p>&#8220;You say he shook hands with you upon it?&#8221; repeated
Redvignez. &#8220;What does all that mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that he is with us heart and soul. He
sees the necessity of putting the captain and mate out
of the way, and he will help do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what about the little girl&ndash;&ndash;the viper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a bad thing for us, Redvig, when we
played that little trick, for I have been ready to despair
more than once, but the remedy is so simple that
I wonder we have not thought of it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will spare her, for Pomp gave me to understand
that on no other conditions would he go into it.
She will be a pleasant playmate for him, and will
help keep him true to us. She is so young and simple-hearted
that we can make her believe that some accident
has befallen the other two, by which they came
to their death, so there will be no danger from anything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
she ever can tell. When we have gathered in
all the pearls we will set sail for South America. At
Valparaiso or some of the ports we will place the girl
in some convent or school, with enough money to take
care of her, and then we will land at another port,
sell the schooner, divide up the proceeds and separate,
each taking a different route home, if we choose to go
there, and then all we&#8217;ll have to do, Redvig, is to
enjoy the wealth which shall be ours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you think it will be?&#8221; asked the
Spaniard, with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no telling,&#8221; was the reply. &#8220;I hardly
dare think, but I know it runs into the hundreds of
thousands, and it is not at all impossible that it
touches the millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Redvignez drew a deep breath and his heart gave
a great throb, as would be the case with the most
phlegmatic being who contemplated the near possession
of such vast wealth. Visions of the wild round
of dissipation and excesses in which they would indulge
came up before the two evil men, and it was no
wonder that they were impatient for the hour to come
when they should strike the blow for the prize. Like
the officers, they were so full of the scheme that they
had no desire to sleep; and while the figure of Mr.
Storms was visible at the wheel, and the <i>Coral</i> sped
on to the southward over the calm, moonlit sea, these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
two men talked about and agreed upon the particulars
of the frightful crime which had been in their
hearts, as may be said, from the moment they hoisted
sail and passed out of San Francisco harbor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>CAPTAIN BERGEN MAKES TWO IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES</h3>
</div>
<p>Before the faintest streak of light appeared in the
eastern horizon, Captain Bergen was awake and in the
rigging, with the binocular glasses in his hand.</p>
<p>The most careful computation showed they were in
latitude about 19 south and longitude 140 west. They
had passed to the eastward of the Mendina Archipelago,
catching a glimpse of one of the islands, where
the mate proposed they should touch and obtain some
supplies. But the captain was too eager to push
ahead, and Grebbens had told him that one peculiarity
about the little island which was their destination
was that it contained fresh water, with some tropical
fruit, while there could be no difficulty in catching all
the fish they wished.</p>
<p>Since the island was altogether uninhabited, and
very rarely visited, it would have been a good thing
for the party could the suggestion of the mate have
been carried out. But it was the conviction of Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Bergen that they would not spend more than two
weeks at the fishery&ndash;&ndash;if such it might be called&ndash;&ndash;and,
under the circumstances, it cannot be said he was
imprudent. Steadying himself with one arm about
the mast, the captain stood firmly in his elevated position,
and, as the sun came slowly up and the golden
radiance spread over the sky and sea, he swept the
arch of the horizon to the south, east and west, straining
his keen vision for the first sight of the eagerly-wished-for
land.</p>
<p>&#8220;Water, water,&#8221; he murmured, despondingly.
&#8220;Water everywhere, and no sight of the haven!
Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>His heart gave a great bound, for, just in the edge
of the horizon&ndash;&ndash;at the very point where ocean and
sky met&ndash;&ndash;he saw a dark substance, like a fleecy vapor,
no bigger than a man&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may be a cloud,&#8221; said the captain to himself, as
he carefully scrutinized it, &#8220;and it may be land; and,
by the great horn spoon, it is land! Land ho!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where away?&#8221; called back Storms, from below,
quite confident what the answer would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two points on the weather-bow.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate headed toward the point indicated, and
then silence reigned for awhile on board, excepting
in the case of Inez, who bounded up on deck, and was
here, there and everywhere.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></div>
<p>The captain was left to himself, for Abe Storms
knew he would come down and report as soon as he
had anything definite; and, in the nature of things,
he could know nothing positive for a considerable
time to come.</p>
<p>As the <i>Coral</i> sped forward&ndash;&ndash;sometimes on the long,
sloping crest of an immense swell, and then again in
the valley between&ndash;&ndash;the captain saw and thought of
nothing else but the little island ahead, which was
slowly rising out of the ocean. He had discovered
that it was circular in shape, quite small, and fringed
with vegetation. This corresponded, in a general way,
with the description given by the sailor in the hospital;
but there are hundreds of other islands in the
South Seas to which the same description will apply,
and it was not impossible that the <i>Coral</i> was many
a long league astray.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was on the island, ten years ago,&#8221; said
Grebbens, &#8220;I found remains of a ship that had been
wrecked there but a short time before. There was a
portion of the mast, which we managed to erect by
scooping a deep hole in the beach and then packing
the sand about the base. On the top of this we kept
our signal of distress flying, in the hope of catching
the notice of some passing vessel, as was the case after
a long while. It was my jacket which fluttered from
the top of that mast, and the old garment has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
blown away long ago; but I don&#8217;t know any reason
why the pole itself shouldn&#8217;t be standing, and if it is,
you will find it on the right of the entrance to the
lagoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The island, it will be understood, was an atoll&ndash;&ndash;that
is, a circular fringe of coral, with a lagoon of the
sea inside which was entered through a comparatively
narrow passage from the ocean. The atoll to which
the old sailor referred was extensive enough to furnish
fresh water and fruit, while at the entrance, and in
other places, there was a sufficient depth of sand to afford
secure &#8220;anchorage&#8221; for the pole which they
erected. Peering through the spy-glass, Captain Bergen
could see the white line where the sea beat against
the coral shores and was rolled back again in foam.
And while he was gazing, his practiced eye detected a
gap in the line of breakers&ndash;&ndash;that is, a spot where the
white foam did not show itself. This must necessarily
be the opening through which the ocean flowed
into the lagoon within the island. Since it met with
no opposition, it swept inward with a smooth, grand
sweep, which proved that the water was deep and
without any obstruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose he deceived me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen asked himself the question while
he was scanning the island.</p>
<p>It was the first time the thought suggested that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
maybe the sailor, dying in the Boston hospital, had
told him an untruth, and such a shuddering, overwhelming
feeling of disappointment came over the
poor fellow at that moment that he grew dizzy and
sick at heart, and came nigh losing his balance.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it cannot be,&#8221; he repeated, rallying himself,
with a great effort. &#8220;I have a better opinion of human
nature than that.&#8221;</p>
<p>His glasses were still pointed in the direction of
the island, and he was peering with an intensity that
was painful at the spot where the dark break in the
foamy breakers showed the entrance to the atoll, when
he detected a black, needle-like column which rose
from the beach at one side of the entrance. It was so
thin that he could not make sure it was not some trick
of his straining vision, and in doubt as to its reality,
he relieved his aching eye by removing the glass for
a moment and looking down on the deck beneath him.</p>
<p>He saw Redvignez and Brazzier standing at the
bow, also gazing toward the island, which was plainly
visible from the deck. They occasionally spoke, but
their tones were so low that no word could be distinguished
by any ears excepting those for which they
were intended. Mr. Storms was at his post, and as
Pomp and Inez were invisible, the conclusion was
inevitable that they were in the cabin, whence issued
the appetizing odor of cooking fish, and where no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
doubt the young lady was receiving the attention
which she expected as her right.</p>
<p>At this instant a peculiar experience came to the
captain of the yacht <i>Coral</i>. A slight flaw in the
breeze, which was bearing the vessel forward, caused
the sails to flap, and must have made a sort of funnel
of one of them for the moment; or rather, as may be
said, it made a temporary whispering gallery of the
deck and rigging of the craft. And being such, it bore
the following ominous words to Captain Bergen, uttered,
as they were, by Hyde Brazzier in a most
guarded undertone:</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall be the two richest men in America!&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen was in that state of intense nervous
sensibility in which his perceptions were unnaturally
acute, and he felt, on the instant the words
struck his ear, that they had a frightful meaning.</p>
<p>The two continued their cautious conference, but
the sail favored acoustics no longer, and the listener
did not catch another syllable.</p>
<p>&#8220;They mean to kill Abe and me,&#8221; he said to himself,
&#8220;and run away with the pearls. If they had determined
to be honest men, and we had secured any
particular amount of wealth, they would have been
rewarded liberally. Forewarned is forearmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen was a brave man, and there was no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
fear of his displaying any shrinking in the crisis
which was evidently close at hand.</p>
<p>Once more he raised the glass to his eye and gazed
toward the inlet of the atoll. During the few minutes
that he had spent in looking down upon the deck and
listening, the schooner had made good speed, and the
island was less than a half mile distant. When the
instrument was pointed toward the place, he saw
clearly and unmistakably the figure of the mast standing
beside the inlet, where it had been placed years
before by Grebbens and his companions.</p>
<p>This, then, was Pearl Island, as the New Englanders
had named it; and here it was that the bed of pearl
oysters of fabulous richness was to be found.</p>
<p>Something like a feeling of depression came over
the captain when he realized that the land of promise
had risen on his vision at last. For days, weeks
and months this had been the one absorbing theme of
his mind. He had dreamed of it until he was almost,
if not quite, a monomaniac, and he had built air-castles
until the whole sky of his vision was filled with
gorgeous structures. And it should be added, in justice
to both Bergen and Storms, that these structures
were creditable to the builders; for, realizing in the
fullest sense that about all they could extract personally
from riches was their own board and lodging,
they had perfected a number of colossal schemes for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
benefiting humanity; indeed, charity was the foundation-stone
of all these castles. And now, after these
long months of waiting, he seemed to see the wealth
lying within his grasp, and something like a reaction
came to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it worth all this?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;Is the
gain likely to pay for the peril in which we have
placed ourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still further, the ominous words which he had
overheard impressed him vividly with the impending
danger in which he and his mate were placed. He saw
now that in taking Brazzier and Redvignez he had
taken two mutineers aboard, and two who, in all probability,
had won the giant African, Pomp, over to
their side.</p>
<p>What was to be the outcome of all this?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>IN THE HAVEN AT LAST</h3>
</div>
<p>As Captain Bergen descended the rigging to the
deck of the schooner he was greatly depressed, for the
conviction was strong upon him that in entering this
promised land&ndash;&ndash;as he had sometimes termed the little
circle of coral and earth which he had named Pearl
Island&ndash;&ndash;he would never leave it. The immense
wealth which lay hidden along its coast, awaiting the
coming of some one to gather it, would never be carried
away by those who had already come more than
half-way round the globe to garner it.</p>
<p>As the captain stepped upon deck, Redvignez and
Brazzier respectfully saluted him, and looked as if
they were the most loyal of sailors.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen forced himself to respond to their
salute, and then he walked quietly over to where Abe
stood at the wheel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what do you make of it?&#8221; asked the mate, in
a low voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the island!&#8221; replied Bergen.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; there can be no doubt. I made out the landmark
that Grebbens told me would identify it beyond
all question. That&#8217;s the mast which they erected on
the shore, close to the inlet. You can see it without
the glass,&#8221; added the captain, turning about and looking
in that direction.</p>
<p>Such was the case, and Storms observed it plainly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, captain?&#8221; asked the mate,
bringing his gaze back to the face of his friend, and
scrutinizing him keenly. &#8220;You look pale and agitated.
Have your nerves given out after this strain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Abe,&#8221; said the captain, in a carefully-guarded
voice, and glancing over his shoulder, &#8220;I learned, a
few minutes ago, that those two men forward intend
to mutiny and run away with the pearls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all? Why, I knew that weeks ago!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; demanded the astounded captain.
&#8220;Why, then, didn&#8217;t you tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was better to wait till we reached the
island, by which time their plans were likely to be
more fully developed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sort of reasoning I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said
the captain, anything but pleased with his mate. &#8220;But
never mind about it now. Tell me what you have
learned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a great deal more than you have told. Those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
two men, I am satisfied, are old acquaintances, who
have been partners in more than one crime, though
we supposed them strangers at the time we shipped
them; and I have no doubt they began planning our
deaths from the day we sailed out of San Francisco
harbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Pomp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They had a hard time, but they have won him
over, and he is pledged to go with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have tried to gain the good will of
Pomp?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done my utmost, and have treated him with
unusual leniency, making him many presents, some of
which I gave him to understand came from you. But
they&#8217;ve got him, for all that. There&#8217;s our greatest
safeguard.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the mate spoke, he pointed to Inez, who, at that
moment, came bounding up the steps of the cabin and
ran laughing forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pomp thinks all the world of her, and she will be
the peacemaker, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t they like her as well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; they wouldn&#8217;t hesitate any more over killing
her than they would in killing us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The villains!&#8221; muttered the horrified captain. &#8220;I
never conceived it possible that any human being
could fail to love such beauty and innocence as hers.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>&#8220;There is no immediate danger,&#8221; said the mate,
somewhat surprised to observe how completely the
discovery had taken possession of the mind of the captain.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s give our attention now to the business
upon which we came, and there will be time enough
to think of the other matter between now and nightfall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen was sorely perplexed, but the circumstances
were such that he was able to follow the
suggestion of his faithful mate. They were now close
to the island, which was of that singular formation so
frequently seen in the Pacific. Countless millions of
tiny insects, toiling through many years, had gradually
lifted the foundations of coral from the depths
of the ocean, until the mass, in the form of a gigantic
ring or horse-shoe, was above the surface. Upon this
had gradually gathered sand, seeds and vegetable matter,
in the usual way, until beneath the tropical sun
and the balmy climate the &#8220;desert blossomed like the
rose.&#8221; This took a long while, but the process it went
through was similar to that of hundreds of much
larger islands which to-day rest like nosegays upon
the bosom of the vast Pacific.</p>
<p>Among these fruits were the banana, plantain,
breadfruit, and a sort of mango, found in Farther
India, and which, at first disliked, becomes in time a
great favorite with every one. Most singular of all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
was the fact that at two widely-separated points burst
forth a spring of clear, fresh water.</p>
<p>One might well wonder where the supply for this
came from, since the whole island had its foundation
in salt water&ndash;&ndash;but there are many strange distillations
going on at all times in nature&#8217;s laboratory beyond the
power of man to fathom.</p>
<p>These were probably stored away in some of the
hidden vaults of the island, and bubbled forth, the
fountain being renewed before the precious contents
were exhausted.</p>
<p>The entrance to the interior was through a deep
passage, toward which Mr. Storms directed the vessel.
As the <i>Coral</i> glided into this &#8220;inland sea,&#8221; Captain
Bergen took the helm, being as familiar with the
contour of the atoll as if he had spent a dozen years
upon it. He knew where the best anchorage was to be
found, and he headed over toward the eastern shore,
where it was safe to run close enough in to spring
from the deck to the land. He was a good seaman,
and he brought his craft to with as much skill as a
stage-driver brings his team to a halt before the door
of an inn. The anchor was let go at the proper moment,
and the <i>Coral</i> slowly swung at her mooring in
the very position her master desired, both bow and
stern being so close to shore that there would be no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
occasion to use the small boat which is generally
called into requisition on such occasions.</p>
<p>The scenery and situation were peculiar and novel
in the highest degree. These atolls are the natural
harbors of the ocean, and if any vessel can run through
the openings into the calm waters within, she may
ride in safety from the severest tempest.</p>
<p>The water within the lagoon was as calm as the
surface of a mill-pond. On every hand rose the trees
and vegetation so dense that the only portion where a
glimpse of the ocean could be caught was at the entrance,
which, it would seem, the builders of the island
had left on purpose for the ingress and exit of endangered
shipping.</p>
<p>Despite the alarming discovery which Captain Bergen
had made but a short time previous, he carried
out the purpose formed weeks before, and which the
mate urged him to fulfil. The schooner having been
secured in position and everything put in ship-shape
order, he addressed the three men who composed the
crew:</p>
<p>&#8220;My friends, when I engaged you to go upon this
voyage, I did not tell you whither, and you may think
it is late in the day to give you such information, now
that we have reached our destination. Some time ago,
before I sailed, I received information that a bed of
oysters existed at a certain portion of this island unusually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
rich in pearls. It is to obtain them I have
come, and now I wish to say, what I determined to
say from the first, that if you work faithfully, and
give me all the assistance you can, each of you three
shall receive enough to make you rich for life. In an
enterprise of this kind the business is a partnership,
and you shall be liberally treated, provided you prove
worthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>During the utterance of these words, both the captain
and the mate carefully watched the faces of the
three men to see the effect produced.</p>
<p>Had the African been alone he would have been
won over, and as it was he turned about in an inquiring
way, and looked toward the two men as if seeking
to see how they took it. Their countenances were
so immobile that he gained no information from the
looks there; but both the officers did. Abe Storms,
especially, was a skilful physiognomist, and that
which he saw convinced him that the speech, coming
as it did, was a mistake. As is frequently the case, it
was accepted as an evidence of timidity on the part
of the officers, and the conspirators were given a confidence
which otherwise would not have been theirs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a blunder,&#8221; whispered Storms, when the
captain stepped beside him. &#8220;Those wretches mean
mischief, and it is coming within twenty-four hours.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE OYSTER BED</h3>
</div>
<p>Little Inez Hawthorne was overrunning with delight
at the prospect of a romp on shore, after having
been confined so long in the cramped quarters of the
schooner, and she was darting hither and thither,
eager to start upon her frolic.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, captain,&#8221; said Hyde Brazzier, bowing profoundly
and with great humility, &#8220;we be greatly surprised
by what you tell us about the pearls, and we
are very much obliged for your kindness, which the
same is a great deal more than we expected; but it
has set us all topsy-turvy, as we may say. If it&#8217;s all
the same, we would like to go and take a look at that
same pearl-oyster bed, if it isn&#8217;t inconvenient.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain and mate both understood the meaning
of this, for it showed only too clearly how impatient
the men were to commit the crime which they had in
mind. Still, there was no excuse for refusal, and the
officers were anxious enough to see the place for themselves.
Each had his revolver carefully shoved into
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
his pocket, and each knew that the six chambers were
fully charged, when they sprang over the vessel&#8217;s side
and started toward the northernmost part of the
island. The captain and mate led the way, for they
were sure they were in no personal danger so long as
the oyster-bed remained undiscovered.</p>
<p>The fringe of coral trees was quite broad, but, as
the little party made their way through them, they
could catch the gleam of the water on each side, while
the roar and boom of the breakers never ceased.</p>
<p>The sun seemed to linger in the horizon to their
left, as if to guide them in the search they were making.</p>
<p>As they advanced, all observed that the outer
rim of this fringe was very irregular, as if it had
been broken up and changed by the action of fierce
tempests for many decades. This peculiarity, if such
it may be termed, left many places where the ocean
was as calm as within the atoll, and it was in one of
these that the oyster-bed for which they were searching
was to be found.</p>
<p>Mate and captain advanced quite spiritedly for
some distance, until they were close to the northernmost
portion, when they hesitated, slackened their
gait, looked to the right and left, conferred in low
tones, and then the captain suddenly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;This looks like the spot!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></div>
<p>The words were scarcely out of his mouth when
the two men dashed down the slight slope, ran a short
distance, and then abruptly halted close to the water&#8217;s
edge, at a point where the sea was locked in so that
it was only slightly disturbed by the ordinary swell.
Close behind them were Redvignez and Brazzier,
while Pomp brought up the rear. The three men exchanged
only a word or two while following, and
those were heard by the leaders, because they were of
no significance, but it is safe to conclude they did a
great deal of thinking.</p>
<p>The five grouped themselves along the water, standing
side by side and peering down into the depths before
them. This perhaps averaged three fathoms, and
the water itself was as clear as crystal, without even
the tinge of green generally seen in the ocean. The
bottom was quite even and flat, resting upon a substratum
of coral. The glinting rays of the sun helped,
so that a marble could have been distinguished many
fathoms down. And looking downward, the quintette
saw the bottom strewn with oysters of unusual size,
lying so close together that in many places they
seemed to touch each other.</p>
<p>For a full minute the five stood motionless and
speechless. It was Pomp who was the first to recover
his voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;My gracious! am dem &#8217;isters full of pearls?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>&#8220;That can only be told by examination,&#8221; was the
quiet reply of Mr. Storms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s ruther deep to dive down, an&#8217; how &#8217;bout
sharks?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought of all that before we left home,
Pomp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what good did all de thinkin&#8217; do? Dat
won&#8217;t drive away de shark, dat would as lief bite a
man in two as to swaller a fish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you and Redvig will return to the vessel and
get that coat of mail on deck, I will agree to go down
there and take all the risks.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three mutineers, as they may be called, exchanged
glances, but said nothing. The captain and
mate noted this telegraphy of the eyes, and they, too,
were silent, but it was a little test which they had determined
upon before leaving the <i>Coral</i>, lying some
distance away, safely moored close inshore. Evidently
the three could think of no valid excuse, and
Brazzier said, in a low voice, which was heard by all:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go, men, and hurry back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pomp started off at once, Redvignez following close
behind him. The mate and captain saw they were
speaking together; but, of course, it could only be conjectured
what they were talking about.</p>
<p>The three who remained behind were in an embarrassing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
situation, for there could be no doubt that
Brazzier, the leader in the plot, had had his suspicions
aroused by this little incident, and it was hard
work for him to conceal a certain uneasiness at the
thought that he had lost the confidence of the two
officers of the <i>Coral</i>.</p>
<p>With a view of strengthening his position, Captain
Bergen took out his revolver, looked at it in an inquiring
way, and then shoved it back into his hip-pocket.
Abe Storms did precisely the same thing, excepting
that he perhaps made a little more display
about it.</p>
<p>Not one of the three as yet had spoken a word; but
Brazzier, as if to conceal his uneasiness, advanced to
the edge of the water and peered down into the crystal
depths at the supposed wealth which lay scattered over
the bottom, awaiting the hour when some one should
draw it forth from the hiding-place it had occupied
for so many years.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;ve got pearls in &#8217;em,&#8221; observed Brazzier,
&#8220;it&#8217;ll make a good haul for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is reason to think so,&#8221; replied the captain,
holding his peace, for he began to suspect that too
much deference had already been paid to the crew.</p>
<p>Since Pomp and Redvignez were making good time,
they soon reappeared, bearing between them the coat
of armor which Abe Storms had constructed before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
leaving his New England home. This, it may be said,
was an invention peculiarly his own, containing some
conveniences not generally attributed to diving-bells
or armor, and which, if they withstood the test to
which they were sure to be subjected, would be a great
step forward in the rapid improvements that have
been made in submarine armor during the last few
years. A superficial examination would not discover
anything out of the usual order in the make of the
armor, with its bulging glass eyes and general resemblance
to the coats of mail such as were used by the
crusaders and knights of the middle ages. There were
the two pipes, one of which went in at the top of the
helmet, as if the man were going to breathe through
the crown of his head, while the other was adjusted so
as to come nearer the front of the face. One of these
was for the admission of fresh air, and the other for
the expulsion of that which was exhaled. Besides this,
there was the rope, fastened around the waist of the
diver, to assist him to the surface should a sudden necessity
arise. But, without going into any detailed description,
we may say that the ingenious New Englander
had so constructed it that he required the assistance
of no second person at any portion of the
work.</p>
<p>Storms immediately began adjusting the apparatus,
the others standing off and looking on, for he had declined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
their proffers of service. The armor had never
been tested, and the man might well pause, now that
he was going to stake his life upon the issue, as may be
said.</p>
<p>But it was not that fact which caused the mate the
most uneasiness, for his confidence in his own invention
was so strong that he would not have hesitated a
moment to trust himself in water of twice the depth.
Indeed, the pearls were so near at hand that a very
ordinary diver would have found no difficulty in
bringing them up without the help of any armor at
all&ndash;&ndash;the latter being required by other considerations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, all I want done is to allow the two upper
ends of the pipes to be kept clear,&#8221; said Storms, when
he had adjusted the &#8220;harness&#8221; about him. &#8220;I will do
the breathing for myself, provided I am not interfered
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two ends were secured among the coral in such
a way that there was no danger of their being drawn
in by any action of the armor itself, and then Storms,
taking an immense sheath-knife in his hand, promptly
stepped off from the shore, and as promptly sank under
water.</p>
<p>It was a singular sight the four companions whom
he left behind saw, when they approached to the edge
of the water and looked over.</p>
<p>The mate, incased in his armor, looked like some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
huge, curiously-shaped shellfish or monster, whose
weight was such that he went as straight down as an
arrow, and, a few seconds later, was seen bent over
and moving about the bottom, loosening up the oysters.</p>
<p>This first venture of Storms&#8217; was more in the nature
of an experiment or preliminary reconnoissance. He
wished to find how the land lay, as the expression
goes. If everything should prove to be in good shape,
he would venture down again, with a basket, and the
real work of gathering the pearl-oysters would begin.</p>
<p>As we have intimated, Abe Storms felt no misgivings
concerning his armor when he moved off from
solid land and was submerged in the edge of the Pacific,
for he had constructed so many contrivances
and machines that he had learned to understand fully
what they would do before they were put to work.
He carried the enormous sheath-knife in his right
hand, and when his feet lightly touched the shells on
the bottom, he began turning them over with the point
of his knife. The depth of the water being so moderate,
he found no difficulty in breathing, and indeed
the conditions were such that whoever chose to collect
the oysters in this armor was not likely to experience
the slightest difficulty.</p>
<p>Down where he was at work the water seemed to
be of a light-yellowish tint, caused by the refraction
of the sunlight as it made its way to him. He noticed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
the mild glow, which, of course, would steadily
diminish as the sun went down, when all at once it
was eclipsed so suddenly by a dark shadow that he
instantly suspected the true cause.</p>
<p>Looking upward, he saw an immense shark, certainly
a dozen feet in length, that had halted and was
evidently surveying with some curiosity this intruder
upon his domains.</p>
<p>The man-eater being directly over the diver, was
not in the best position to use his fearful jaws with
effect, but he was evidently reconnoitering with a view
to hostilities. Abe observed that this shadowy figure
was motionless, its fins slightly moving back and forth
as if it were using them like a balancing-pole, to maintain
itself motionless in position, and he marked the
horridly-shaped mouth which yawned over his head.
Reaching upward with his long-bladed knife, he
touched it against the white belly of the monster, and
then gave it a strong push.</p>
<p>It was so keen and sharp that it entered deep into
the yielding flesh and inflicted a severe wound. Just
then the gigantic man-eater suspected he had committed
a blunder, and with a lightning-like whirl of
his huge body, he dashed out to sea, leaving a crimson
trail after him.</p>
<p>Indeed, his charge was so sudden that the huge
knife was wrenched from the grasp of Abe Storms,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
and he was drawn forward off his balance. Had it
been in the open air, he would have been hurled to the
ground with great force. But he managed to recover
himself, and caught a shadowy glimpse of the great
shark darting off, as the knife dropped from the
wound and sank to the bottom. Not wishing to lose
the valuable weapon, Storms walked forward, and seeing
it lying on the bottom, at a point which seemed
to be the edge of the oyster-bed, he stooped over and
recovered it.</p>
<p>He had now been down a considerable while, and
muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain promised to signal me if trouble came,
and he hasn&#8217;t done so. But, for all that, I don&#8217;t believe
it will be safe for me to stay down here much
longer. I may as well&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence was never finished, for it received a
startling interruption. The rubber pipes by which
he breathed were suddenly closed, and Abe Storms
knew it had been done purposely by some one above.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE REVOLT</h3>
</div>
<p>For a brief while after the descent of the mate of
the <i>Coral</i>, incased in his new diving armor, the four
men above did nothing more than merely wait for his
coming up. But all the time the parties were watching
each other, for Captain Bergen was convinced that
the crisis was at hand. The mutineers had learned
where the oyster-bed was, and therefore could be no
longer restrained by that consideration. They could
get on without the diving-armor, though they saw how
convenient it might be to have it; but, since it was connected
with the shore, it could be drawn in and recovered
if they should need it.</p>
<p>The mate was down in the ocean, and the captain
was standing on terra firma. What more favorable
separation was likely to present itself? Here were
three men against one, and the three had gained the
secret which had restrained them so long.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; said Hyde Brazzier, &#8220;does the mate down
there find things as he expected?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&#8220;We can tell that better after he comes up,&#8221; was the
reply of the captain, who kept his hand at his hip,
where it could rest on the butt of his revolver. &#8220;But
there is reason to believe that he isn&#8217;t disappointed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he breathes through these pipes that lie
here?&#8221; pursued Brazzier, while the expression on the
face of Pomp and Redvignez convinced Skipper Bergen
that serious mischief was coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can see that without asking me,&#8221; replied he,
stepping back a pace or two so as to keep the men before
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if a man can&#8217;t get what air he wants, what
is likely to happen?&#8221; continued Brazzier, with an insolent
swagger that was exasperating, following upon
his fawning sycophancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any fool would know that he would die.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now that we&#8217;ve landed, I don&#8217;t see as there
is any need of a mate or a captain neither, with this
crew&ndash;&ndash;do you, boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he turned toward his companions with a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. The best place for him is in Davy
Jones&#8217; locker!&#8221; said Redvignez.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you is talkin&#8217; right!&#8221; was the characteristic
comment of the negro, Pomp, who seemed the most
eager of the three, when the mutiny had come to a
head.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>It was evident that Brazzier had determined to
drown the mate while he was below the surface.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first man who interferes with those pipes I
will shoot dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen spoke the words in a low voice, but
there could be no mistaking his deadly earnestness.
Feeling that the crisis had come, the captain determined
to give the signal agreed upon with Abe Storms,
which was a sudden jerk of the rope fastened to the
one around the waist of the mate. The latter would
understand that his presence above was needed at
once.</p>
<p>The captain was in the act of stooping over, when
Redvignez sprang behind him with the stealth and
agility of a cat, and struck his arm a violent blow.
His purpose was to knock the revolver out of the captain&#8217;s
hand, so that he and his friends could secure
the use of it. But he overdid the matter, for the revolver
went spinning out of the captain&#8217;s hand and
dropped into the water, where it sank out of sight.
Startled and shocked, he straightened up without giving
the signal to Abe Storms below the surface.</p>
<p>None of the party had any firearms, but Captain
Bergen saw it would be madness for him to make any
resistance. Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation, therefore,
he wheeled about and ran with all the speed of which
he was capable.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></div>
<p>His flight was not altogether an aimless one, for
he hoped to reach the schooner, lying an eighth of a
mile away, far enough in advance of his pursuers to
seize one of the rifles carefully concealed there, and to
make defense against his foes. The instant he broke
into a run, his pursuers did the same, uttering loud
shouts, as if they were American Indians who were
certain of their prey.</p>
<p>For the time, it was a question of speed between
pursuers and pursued. If the latter could reach the
craft considerably ahead of the others, there was a
chance of his making a successful defense against the
three who were seeking his life. If he failed to attain
the goal, he felt it would be all over with him, for
they were not the men to show any mercy.</p>
<p>Darting among the palm-trees, therefore, he
strained every nerve to draw away from his enemies,
while they strove, with equal desperation, to overtake
him.</p>
<p>It was a straight run, and comparatively an unobstructed
one, for the palm-trees were far enough apart
to give him a pretty fair course, which was of equal
advantage to all parties. Perhaps it is possible, therefore,
to imagine the anxiety with which, after running
a short distance, Captain Bergen glanced over his
shoulder to see how his pursuers were making out.
But it is not possible to appreciate his consternation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
when he saw that two of them were outrunning him,
and, as he had striven to his very utmost, the frightful
truth was manifest that he was sure to be overtaken
before he could reach the <i>Coral</i>.</p>
<p>Those who were gaining upon him were Pomp, the
negro, and Brazzier himself. But the fact that they
were gaining upon him was no cause for the fugitive
falling down and yielding without a struggle. He
still had his sheath-knife, which he grasped with a
despairing feeling as he realized, during those awful
seconds, that complete, disastrous failure, instead of
the brilliant success he had counted upon, had overtaken
him at last.</p>
<p>The pursuers gained rapidly, and not one-half the
distance was passed, when all three of the men were
almost within striking distance, for Redvignez was at
the elbow of his companions. Captain Bergen looked
over his shoulder, and was about to throw his back
against a palm-tree, with the view of turning at bay
and fighting to the last, when, like the historical John
Smith of our own earlier times, his lack of attention
to his feet precipitated the very fate against which he
was struggling. His feet struck some obstruction, and
being exhausted from his extraordinary exertion, he
pitched forward and fell on his face. As he went
down he was conscious of hearing two widely different
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
sounds&ndash;&ndash;one the exultant cries of the pursuers, and
the other the terrified scream of a little girl.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen attempted to rise, but Redvignez
and Brazzier were upon him, and the knife of the latter
was upraised with the purpose of ending the matter
then and there forever, when the cry of the child
was heard the second time, and little Inez sprang, like
Pocahontas, between the uplifted arm and the intended
victim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t hurt him! Please don&#8217;t hurt him!
Please, please don&#8217;t hurt him, &#8217;cause I love him!&#8221;
pleaded the agonized child, with all the earnestness of
her nature.</p>
<p>The position of the prostrate captain attempting to
rise, and the little one interceding for him, was such
that the mutineer hesitated for the moment, for he
could not strike without endangering her life. Seeing
this, with the wonderful quickness which sometimes
comes over the youngest child in such a crisis,
Inez persistently forced her body with amazing quickness
in the way of the poised knife as it started to descend
more than once&ndash;&ndash;the other two holding back for
their leader to finish the work.</p>
<p>Brazzier was a man of tigerish temper, and he became
infuriated in a few seconds at this repeated
baffling of his purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Confound you!&#8221; he suddenly exclaimed, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
fierce execration. &#8220;If you will keep in the way, then
you must take it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The arm was drawn still further back, with the intention
of carrying out this dreadful threat, when the
wrist was seized in the iron grip of Black Pomp, who
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on, dere! None ob dat! De man dat hurts a
ha&#8217;r ob dat little gal&#8217;s head will got sot down on by me,
an&#8217; mashed so flat dat he&#8217;ll neber rose ag&#8217;in. Does
you hear me, sah?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE FRIEND IN NEED</h3>
</div>
<p>There was no excuse for not hearing this warning,
for it was uttered in a voice loud enough to reach
over the whole extent of the atoll.</p>
<p>Both Redvignez and Brazzier were enraged at the
interference, and there was an instant of time when
the two were on the point of attacking him. But he
was a terrible foe for any one to assail, and he would
have made warm work, as they well knew, for he was
not afraid of the two together.</p>
<p>Brazzier was quick to comprehend the situation,
and he refrained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take away the girl, then,&#8221; he commanded, &#8220;so I
can get at him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not leave him,&#8221; declared Inez, throwing her
arms about the neck of the captain, who was rising to
his feet. &#8220;You mean to hurt him, and you shan&#8217;t hurt
him without hurting me. He has been kind, and he&#8217;s
a good man.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Take her away,&#8221; commanded Brazzier, with difficulty
repressing his anger at the repeated delay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Pomp! You won&#8217;t let him hurt the captain?&#8221;
pleaded Inez, turning toward him, and ready to throw
her arms about his dusky neck, were it not that she
was afraid to leave the captain for the moment&ndash;&ndash;he
having risen to his feet, while he held her hand and
looked at his enemies, panting from his own great
exertion, though he did not speak a word.</p>
<p>Even in the dreadful peril which enveloped him, he
was too proud to ask for mercy from such wretches.</p>
<p>But the appeal of Inez to Pomp had produced its
effect. When she turned her misty eyes upon him,
and pleaded in such piteous tones for mercy, the
mouth of the huge African twitched, and any one
could see that a hard struggle was going on within.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t keep those bad men from hurting
Captain Bergen,&#8221; she added, in the same impassioned
manner, &#8220;I&#8217;ll never speak to you&ndash;&ndash;never, never, never&ndash;&ndash;there!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was accompanied by a stamp of her tiny foot,
and then she burst into weeping&ndash;&ndash;sobbing as if her
heart would break.</p>
<p>Hyde Brazzier stood irresolute, and seemed on the
point of leaping, knife in hand, upon the captain.
But the prayer of the innocent child had settled the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
question, and the sable Hercules sprang in front of
the endangered man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dis &#8217;ere thing hab gone fur &#8217;nough; let de cap&#8217;in
alone. If dere&#8217;s any killin&#8217; to be done, why I&#8217;m de
one dat&#8217;s gwine to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two mutineers were wild with fury, for this
unexpected show of mercy promised to upset the whole
scheme they had been hatching for weeks. Both Redvignez
and Brazzier protested vehemently, seeking to
show that it was imperatively necessary that both the
officers should be put out of the way, and that since
the mate was gone, it was the sheerest folly to allow
the captain to remain.</p>
<p>But the words were thrown away.</p>
<p>The prayer of little Inez Hawthorne had reached
the heart of the gigantic African, and the sight of the
child standing there weeping was more than he could
bear, although it but served to add to the exasperation
of the other two savages.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen did not stand mute and motionless
during all this rush of events, which really occupied
but a few seconds. As soon as he saw the way open,
he took the hand of little Inez and began moving in
the direction of the schooner, his purpose being to
secure refuge upon that if possible. As he moved
away he saw Pomp and the two mutineers in conference,
for Brazzier and Redvignez at that moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
would have given a large share of their prospective
wealth for the purpose of disposing finally and forever
of the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been in mutinies before, Pomp, and the
only safe course&ndash;&ndash;and that ain&#8217;t safe by any means&ndash;&ndash;is
to follow the rule that dead men tell no tales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat may be de rule, but it ain&#8217;t gwine to work in
dis case; an&#8217; de reason am &#8217;cause de little gal dere
don&#8217;t want it done. You can talk an&#8217; argufy fo&#8217; fourteen
years, but it won&#8217;t do no good. De only way you
can finish up de job am by killin&#8217; me fust.&#8221;</p>
<p>The foregoing is the substance of the protests and
replies of the two parties to the angry discussion. It
so happened, as we have shown, that the African held
the balance of power. He was strong and courageous,
and he was armed and ready to fight, and they knew
it. They did not dare to attack him openly, where the
result was so likely to be disastrous to both, and they
were compelled to fall in with his scheme of saving
the captain, though it can well be understood that it
was the most distasteful thing to which they could
consent.</p>
<p>This discussion lasted but a few minutes; but, as
we have said, it was improved by Captain Bergen,
who saw that the wisest course for him to pursue was
to remove the cause as far as practical. He walked
backward a few steps until he was some way off, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
he turned about, still holding the hand of Inez in his,
and they continued until a number of palm-trees intervened,
when he sped so rapidly that the child was
kept on a run to maintain her place at his side. She
had ceased her crying, but her face and eyes were red,
and she was in an apprehensive, nervous and almost
hysterical condition from the terrible scene she had
witnessed&ndash;&ndash;a scene such as should never be looked
upon by one of her tender years.</p>
<p>A minute later Captain Bergen caught sight of the
trimly-built schooner lying at rest in the lagoon, close
to the shore, and his heart gave a throb of hope, that,
if he could once secure position on her deck, he would
be able to hold his own against the mutineers.</p>
<p>During the next few hurried minutes occupied in
the passage to the schooner, the conviction had grown
upon him that this mercy which had spared his life
for a brief while would not be continued. Pomp
Cooper would not continue to be his friend after his
spasm of affection for Inez should spend itself, and
devoid as the African was of intellect, he was likely
to understand that the true course of the party who
had entered upon the villainy was to make thorough
work of it.</p>
<p>The captain saw the three men still talking and gesticulating
angrily when he reached the schooner.</p>
<p>In a twinkling he had lifted Inez upon the deck,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
and then he sprang after her. He ran into the cabin,
reappearing in an instant with the three loaded rifles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said he, with a sigh of relief, &#8220;let them
come! I am ready.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XVI_A_STRANGE_VISITOR' id='CHAPTER_XVI_A_STRANGE_VISITOR'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE VISITOR</h3>
</div>
<p>But the mutineers took good care not to show
themselves just then; and the captain, deeming such a
course prudent, tugged at the anchor until it was
lifted, when he managed to shove the craft off, and
reaching the middle of the lagoon, the anchor was
dropped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now they won&#8217;t be likely to approach without my
seeing them,&#8221; was his conclusion; &#8220;and so long as I
can keep awake, I can hold them at bay. I hate to
shoot a man, but if ever a person had justification for
doing so, I have. I am rather inclined to think that if
either Brazzier or Redvignez should wander into
range, one of these rifles would be likely to go off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing no immediate danger, Captain Bergen descended
into the cabin for a few minutes. Poor, tired
Inez had thrown herself on the hammock and was
sound asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleep, little one,&#8221; murmured the captain, as he
lingered for a minute to look at the sweet, infantile
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
face, in the gathering twilight. &#8220;It is a sad fate
which orders you to witness so much violence, and
sorry I am that it is so; but where would I have been
excepting for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he softly left the cabin and took his position
on deck. The moon was full, which was gratefully
noticed by the captain, for he could easily keep awake
all night, and thus detect the approach of his enemies.
In fact, his nerves were so unstrung that he would not
be able to sleep for many hours to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is to be done hereafter?&#8221;</p>
<p>This was the question he put to himself, and which
had to be answered.</p>
<p>The mutineers kept carefully out of sight, and, as
night settled over the scene, the captain remained
wide awake and vigilant. There was ample food for
thought and reflection&ndash;&ndash;the cutting of the hose-pipes
of the diving apparatus, the attack by the mutineers,
the terrible flight and pursuit, the interference of
Inez&ndash;&ndash;all these and more surged through the brain of
the captain, while he slowly paced back and forth,
with eyes and ears wide open. Inez still slumbered,
and all was silent, excepting the boom of the ocean
against the coral-reef; while, as the night wore on, the
captain maintained his lonely watch.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen scanned the fringe of shore which
circled about him, like a great wall thrown up between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
the lagoon and the Pacific, that steadily broke
on the outside. But turn his keen eyes wheresoever
he chose, he could detect not the slightest sign of the
mutineers. He thought it likely they would start a
fire somewhere, but no starlike point of light twinkled
from beneath the palm-trees, and he was left to conjecture
where they were and what they were doing.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will probably wait till they think I am
asleep,&#8221; was his thought, &#8220;and then they will swim
quietly out and try to board.&#8221;</p>
<p>He believed it would be either that way or they
would construct a raft and paddle themselves out to
the schooner. Knowing the captain was on the Coral,
and knowing how important it was that he should not
be allowed to run away and leave them there, they
would neglect no precaution to prevent his going off.
They, too, would understand what it was he was waiting
for, and they were seamen enough to know the
hour when he would be able to sail, and, consequently,
what they were to do to prevent it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have no way of closing the channel, or they
would do so, and it remains&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>He was standing at the prow, looking carefully
about him, and with all his senses alert, and he stood
thus fully twenty minutes, expecting something whose
precise nature he had already conjectured.</p>
<p>&#8220;That splash meant something, and I think&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></div>
<p>Just then he heard a commotion in the water
directly under the prow, and, looking over, he saw a
strange-looking object, like one of the uncouth monsters
of the deep, come to the surface and begin climbing
up by aid of the fore-chains.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, cap&#8217;n, can&#8217;t you give a fellow a lift?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the mate, Abe Storms, who asked the question,
and, as the captain extended his hand, he said,
in a low, fervent voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank heaven! I was about giving you up for
lost!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>ON THE CORAL</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Bergen and Abe Storms, as may be supposed,
greeted each other ardently when the latter
stepped upon the deck of the schooner, clad in his
diving-suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was growing very anxious about you,&#8221; said the
captain, &#8220;for I could not understand what kept you
away so long.&#8221;</p>
<p>The eccentric New Englander, removing his headgear,
but leaving the rest of his armor on, laughed and
asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me what took place after I went down.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain hurriedly related his experience, which
has been already told the reader.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took a good deal of risk, as you know,&#8221; said
the mate, &#8220;and when I went down in the water, I was
a great deal more uneasy than I seemed to be. I was
expecting a signal from you, and when it did not
come I started for the surface. The shore is rough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
and craggy, you know, so that it was something like
climbing up stairs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I had got pretty well up when the pipes
were cut. I understood what it meant, and, holding
my breath, with the water rushing down the two hose-pipes,
I scrambled for the top.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may have been a perilous thing for you that
the rascals pursued you with such enthusiasm, but it
was fortunate for me, for, although I had a dry revolver
under my armor, it was several minutes before
I was in a condition to use it.</p>
<p>&#8220;As soon as possible, however, I made ready, believing
you were in sore need of help. Crawling forward
on my hands and knees, I took a quick look over the
bank, and saw you and Inez walking off in the direction
of the schooner, with the three scamps sullenly
watching you.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspected what you tell me was the truth, and
I was on the point of rushing forward and making
short work of them with my revolver, but it flashed
upon me that they possessed a fearful advantage over
us. Redvignez and Brazzier are as cunning as serpents,
and one of them, more than likely, would have
caught up the little girl and held her in front of him
as a screen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inez would have proved an effectual armor, indeed,
and, with her in their possession, they would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
have been masters of the situation, and could have
dictated whatever terms they chose to us. Pomp
would have been transformed into a bitter enemy at
once, and the chances of disaster to us all were so
great that I remained quiet, but watchful, ready to
dash forward to your assistance should it become
necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I lay down in a secluded place to rest, when&ndash;&ndash;shall
I confess it?&ndash;&ndash;I fell asleep, and did not wake up until
half an hour ago. After thinking the matter over, I
decided still to deceive the rascals. I was quite certain
that the water in the lagoon was not very deep,
so I fastened the upper ends of the hose to floats, and
walked out here on the bottom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see anything of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I don&#8217;t know where they are; but you can
feel sure they&#8217;ll never take their eyes off the
schooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>After further discussing the exciting events of the
day, they considered the all-important question as to
what should be their own line of action. The decision
which they reached was a most remarkable one, being
no less than to make a direct proposition to the mutineers
to turn over the schooner to them, with a portion
of the oysters, and to allow them to depart, while
the captain, mate and little girl were left upon the
island.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></div>
<p>The captain was not convinced that this was altogether
wise, and he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since your plan is for us to stay on the island, and
allow them to leave with the schooner, will you tell
me how we are to depart, when ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate indicated the inlet, where the mast was
still pointing toward the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to run our chances. We may be taken
off in a week, and possibly not for years; but, with all
these probabilities before us, I am in favor of surrendering
the schooner, and allowing them to leave
us forever, if they will agree to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, if we make the proposition, will they not suspect
our purpose, or take it as a confession of weakness
on our part?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We must prevent that. But, captain, I&#8217;ve had
all the sleep I want, and you are in need of it. Better
secure it, therefore, while you can. Go below in the
cabin and take your rest. I will stand guard here,
and you need have no fear of my dropping into slumber
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain remained some time longer, and even
then was loth to leave, but he consented to do so, and
finally descended into the cabin, where he threw himself
upon his hammock without removing his clothes.</p>
<p>The incidents of the day were exciting enough to
keep him awake, and, despite the exhaustion of his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
body, he lay a long time before he closed his eyes in
slumber. Even then his sleep was haunted by horrible
dreams, in which he lived over again the scenes
through which he had passed, when, but for the piteous
pleadings of little Inez, he would have fallen a
victim to the ferocity of the mutineers, and he awoke
more than once with a gasp and a start, which showed
how disturbed his mind was.</p>
<p>He had not slept long when he suddenly awoke
again, and looked around in the gloom. The lamp
overhead had been extinguished, and he was in utter
darkness, though the silvery glow of the moonlight
outside was perceptible through the windows and
partly-open door. He could hear the dull booming of
the breakers on the outside of the atoll, but all else
was quiet, except the gentle breathing of Inez, in the
berth beneath his.</p>
<p>&#8220;God protect her and us all!&#8221; he prayed, his heart,
in the solemn stillness and solitude, ascending to the
only being who could assist him and his friend in
their dire extremity; for Captain Bergen was sure
that no one could be placed in greater peril than were
he and Abe Storms, so long as they remained among
the Pearl Islands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>A VISIT FROM SHORE</h3>
</div>
<p>In the meantime Abram Storms was acting the
part of a vigilant sentinel at his station on deck.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in his mind that the mutineers
were fearful the schooner would sail away and leave
them on the lonely coral island, and they were certain,
as he viewed it, to make some effort to prevent
such a disaster to them. But precisely how this was to
be done was a serious question. They knew that the
captain, having reached the <i>Coral</i>, had several rifles
at command, and would not hesitate to shoot them
the instant any attempt was made against him or little
Inez, under his charge.</p>
<p>Nothing was more certain than that an unremitting
watch would be kept upon the <i>Coral</i>, and, though
they might believe there was but the single man there,
yet unquestionably he commanded the situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will try some trick,&#8221; muttered the mate;
&#8220;but I shall have a very small opinion of myself if
they win. Pomp Cooper&#8217;s affection for Inez led him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
to interfere, when his interference accomplished a
good deal more than he imagined. Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment the mate heard a ghostly &#8220;Halloo!&#8221;
from the shore, and he recognized the voice as belonging
to Pomp.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just as I suspected,&#8221; said Storms, to himself;
&#8220;they&#8217;re using the negro as a cat&#8217;s-paw. Well, I&#8217;ll see
what they are driving at.&#8221;</p>
<p>Imitating the tones of Captain Bergen as closely
as possible, the mate shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Am you dere?&#8221; was the rather superfluous question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you let me come on board?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sick ob dis business. I hab quarreled wid
Redvig an&#8217; Brazzier, an&#8217; I want to jine you an&#8217; git
away from dis place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abe Storms was not deceived for a moment by this
transparent story. He knew there had been no quarrel,
but that the mutineers had planned to get the negro
on the schooner with the hope of deceiving the captain
and gaining a chance to overpower him when off
his guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on out here, then,&#8221; replied the mate, who
quickly determined his course of action.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></div>
<p>Almost at the same instant a loud splash was heard,
and the head of Pomp was descried in the moonlight,
swimming toward the boat. The mate kept himself
concealed as much as he could, stepping back when the
negro began clambering up the fore-chains. Panting
from his exertion, he speedily came over the gunwale
upon the deck.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, cap&#8217;in, I&#8217;s tired ob dem willains, an&#8217; I&#8217;m
gwine&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Oh! oh! oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>At that instant his eyes fell upon the figure of the
mate, clad in his diving-armor, with the exception
of his face, which was so clearly revealed in the moonlight
that there could be no mistaking his identity.</p>
<p>Worse than that, the mate, standing as rigid as
iron, had a gleaming revolver pointed straight at him.
Pomp sank on his knees in the most abject terror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my heben!&#8221; he chattered, clasping his hands,
&#8220;I t&#8217;ought dat you was drowned. Am you sartin dat
you ain&#8217;t?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite well satisfied on that point. But,
Pomp, get up; I&#8217;ve got a word or two to say to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, I will; but please p&#8217;int dat weepon some
oder way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate complied, and the African, somewhat reassured,
though still considerably frightened, listened
to the words of the man who he supposed was drowned
hours before.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I am alive and well, Pomp, as you can see, and so
is the captain, who is taking a short nap in the cabin.
We are well armed, as you know&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yas! yas! yas!&#8221; chattered the negro.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we can sail away in the morning, at the
turning of the tide, and leave you here&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat&#8217;s what I want you to do, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll go wid you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t go! I know well enough what you came
out here for. You thought you would find a chance
to get the upper hand of the captain, and would let the
other villains on board. There! you needn&#8217;t deny it.
I understand the matter too well to be deceived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I sabe de cap&#8217;in&#8217;s life?&#8221; quavered Pomp,
still fearful of the cold, measured tones of the mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You befriended him at a critical moment, and
therefore I won&#8217;t shoot you, when I have such a good
chance to do so. But you have regretted your interference
more than once, and you are seeking now to
undo all the good you have done. We have it in our
power not only to go away, but to bring back a force
which shall hang every one of you three, as you deserve
to be, but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! oh-o-o-o!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we don&#8217;t propose to do it. We are not going
away to leave you here. To-morrow we shall have a
proposal to offer to your mates, which they will be
glad to accept. That is about all I have to say to you.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIX_THE_DEPARTURE' id='CHAPTER_XIX_THE_DEPARTURE'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THE DEPARTURE</h3>
</div>
<p>As Mate Storms said, he had but little more communication
to make with the negro.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may now swim back to your friends and say
that we will be ready to negotiate to-morrow morning.
If they will come down to the shore, we will have a
talk and arrange the whole business. Now, perhaps,
you had better go back.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pomp Cooper was quick-witted enough to understand
that this utterance was in the nature of a hint
for him to depart, and he stood not on the order of his
going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by, sah,&#8221; he called out. &#8220;Much obleege fo&#8217;
your kindness, dat I shall remember a good while.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mate Storms stood motionless, watching him until
he was perhaps a hundred feet from the craft, when
he said, just loud enough to be heard:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sharks are mighty plenty hereabout, and I saw a
big one yesterday. Shouldn&#8217;t wonder if he has a leg
bit off before he gets back.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>Pomp heard the words, and they &#8220;disturbed&#8221; him,
to put it mildly. Evidently he had forgotten the
peril to which all persons are exposed in tropical waters,
and, as the truth was impressed upon him with
such suddenness, he uttered a &#8220;whiff&#8221; like a porpoise
and began swimming with fierce energy toward the
shore. In fact, he never put forth so much effort in
all his life. The expectation of feeling a huge
man-eating monster gliding beneath you when in
the water is enough to shake the nerves of the strongest
swimmer. He kept diving and swimming as far as he
could below the surface, and then came up and continued
his desperate efforts until he reached the land,
where he joined his companions.</p>
<p>Abe Storms stood looking and listening, his face expanded
in a broad smile, when he heard a light laugh
at his elbow. Turning his head, he found the captain
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard your summons to him,&#8221; said the captain,
by way of explanation, &#8220;and I came up to hear what
it meant. I must admit, you managed the case well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have been worse. My only fear is that
the imps won&#8217;t believe we honestly intend to hold the
conference with them, and offer a compromise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They will find it out at daylight, and meanwhile
they can&#8217;t help themselves. It is useless for me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
stay below, Abe,&#8221; added the nervous captain. &#8220;There&#8217;s
too much on my mind to sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>Therefore, the two remained on watch until the sun
rose, at which time there was nothing to be seen of the
mutineers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re suspicious,&#8221; concluded the mate, who
called out, in a loud voice that reached every portion
of the island:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, men! come and show yourselves. We want
to have a talk with you!&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Hyde Brazzier appeared on
the shore and answered back again. It was deemed
best to give the mutineers a proof of their sincerity,
and instead, therefore, of holding the conversation
from the deck of the schooner, the small boat was
lowered, and both the captain and mate entered it and
rowed ashore, where all three awaited them, as may
be supposed, with some degree of astonishment.</p>
<p>Storms and Captain Bergen were not without some
misgivings, and they did not venture unprepared into
the lion&#8217;s den. Both carried a loaded revolver at command,
and in case of an attack the business would
have been lively. But it was unreasonable to suppose
that our friends would be assailed under the peculiar
circumstances. Furthermore, as the parties understood
each other, there was no time wasted in reproaches
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
or recriminations, but Captain Bergen came
directly to the point.</p>
<p>&#8220;This state of things can&#8217;t last,&#8221; said he; &#8220;we are
deadly enemies, and we would kill each other on the
slightest pretext. The island is too small to contain
us all. Either you three or we two must leave before
the sun reaches meridian, or we shall go to fighting
like caged tigers. Neither can we go away
together, for I would not trust any of you again, nor
would you trust either of us; therefore, one party
must go, and the other must stay&ndash;&ndash;which shall it be?
We were prepared to leave, when we reflected that if
we should be caught in some of the storms which
sweep over this region, the mate and I would hardly
be able to manage the schooner, and we are anxious to
take care of the little girl, to whom we are greatly
attached. There are three of you, all able-bodied
seamen, and in case of a tempest you would be able to
navigate the <i>Coral</i>. It would be safer, therefore, for
you to take the vessel and go to some of the ports,
secure assistance and send them after us. We make,
therefore, this proposition: We will turn over the
schooner to you, on condition that you leave with us
such stores as we may choose to take, and that you
proceed at once to the nearest of the inhabited Paumotu
Islands and send assistance to us. Furthermore,
as you know all about the pearl-oysters, we will agree
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
to divide with you. You can take up half of what are
on the bed out yonder, and you may carry them away
with you, leaving a moiety to us. You are to sail just
as soon as the oysters are placed on board. That&#8217;s
our proposition&ndash;&ndash;what do you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>There could be no doubt that the mutineers were
astonished by the generosity of the offer, coming, as
it did, from those who were in reality masters of the
situation.</p>
<p>Had they been a little more cunning, they might
have suspected there was something behind it all,
which was kept carefully out of sight; but the terms
were so good that Brazzier answered, the instant the
question was put to him:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do it, and carry out our part fair and
square.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well; there&#8217;s no need of delay. We&#8217;ll bring
the schooner inshore and take out what we want, and
then turn the craft over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>This amazing programme was carried out to the letter.
Captain and mate, accompanied by Pomp, rowed
back in the small boat, and the schooner was carefully
worked toward the shore.</p>
<p>Abe Storms and Captain Bergen saw that among
the possibilities of the future was a long stay on the
lonely island, and they therefore prepared for such a
contingency, having an eye mainly to securing that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
which little Inez would be likely to need. Pomp informed
the officers that there was a small cabin a
short distance away, which had no doubt been put up
by the sailors of whom Grebbens had told the captain.
It was made of planking that had come ashore from
the wreck, and the fact that it had stood so long
proved that it must have been built with much skill
as well as strength.</p>
<p>It was found just as represented by Pomp&ndash;&ndash;there
being two compartments, each a dozen feet or so
square, and one of these was so well put together that
it seemed to be waterproof. Our friends were greatly
surprised and pleased over the discovery, for Grebbens
had never said anything about the structure.</p>
<p>The goods from the <i>Coral</i> were carried to this building
and deposited in the rear room, which was so
tight that one would have almost suffocated had he remained
in it during the tropical weather which prevails
among the Paumotu Islands most of the time.</p>
<p>The goods stowed there were of a varied assortment,
including the three breech-loading rifles, ammunition,
tool-chest and contents, a portion of the medicine-chest,
some biscuits, cooking utensils, and a trunk of
calicoes, linens and materials such as are used
in the making of feminine costumes. It was a
singular coincidence that Abe Storms had provided
a considerable quantity of this before leaving
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
San Francisco, knowing as he did the fondness
of savages for such finery, and having a suspicion
that it might be turned to good account in the way
of barter in some of the South Sea islands. Little did
he suspect the use to which it would be put, and
thankful indeed was he that it was at his command,
when it was so likely to be needed for Inez
Hawthorne.</p>
<p>There was a goodly amount of stock, which was
transferred to the cabin, the mutineers assisting with
the rest, for all felt there was no time to lose. There
was mistrust at first, each party seeming to be suspicious
of the other, but it soon wore off, and any one
looking upon them could not have been made to believe
they were deadly enemies.</p>
<p>When the transfer was completed, it was evident
that the current was close upon its turn, and unless
they should leave the island soon, they would be compelled
to wait perhaps twelve or twenty-four hours
longer.</p>
<p>Since the sea was very calm, Hyde Brazzier proposed
that the schooner should be taken outside and
anchored directly over the pearl-oyster bed, so that
sail could be hoisted as soon as they were ready.
There was a slight risk in the action, but it was done,
and after some careful maneuvering the <i>Coral</i> was
secured in position.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<p>It looked very magnanimous and somewhat stupid
for Abe Storms to volunteer to go down in his coat of
armor and scoop the oysters into a huge basket, for
the very parties who had tried so hard to drown him
when similarly engaged the day before. Nothing, it
would seem, could be more absurd, and yet the reader
is requested to suspend judgment until he shall have
read the following chapter.</p>
<p>All this was done, and in the course of the succeeding
two hours fully three-fourths of the oysters scattered
over that particular bed were dumped upon the
deck of the <i>Coral</i>, and Abe Storms, pretty well exhausted,
was pulled to the surface. The captain and
mate, with the armor, rowed themselves the short distance
ashore in the small boat. The <i>Coral</i> hoisted
sail, and, heading out to sea, rapidly sped away over
the Pacific.</p>
<p>And all this time the three mutineers felicitated
themselves upon the manner in which they had gotten
the best of the bargain. And yet, never in all their
lives had they been so completely outwitted as they
were by Abe Storms and Captain Jack Bergen, as we
shall now proceed to show.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XX_HOW_DIAMOND_CUT_DIAMOND' id='CHAPTER_XX_HOW_DIAMOND_CUT_DIAMOND'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>HOW DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND</h3>
</div>
<p>The three mutineers on board the schooner Coral
had sailed away and disappeared from view on the
face of the vast Pacific, and the captain and mate
were left with little Inez alone upon a small, lonely
member of the Paumotu Group, in the distant South
Seas.</p>
<p>Inez was too young to realize the gravity of the
situation, and she ran hither and thither, delighted
with her new home, though she found the cabin too
warm inside to be comfortable, and she made frequent
draughts upon the spring of cool, clear water near
which the former residents of the atoll had built
the cabin. Then, too, she had found that there was
considerable tropical fruit growing in the place, and
she made such havoc among it that Captain Bergen
felt impelled to caution her, if she should become sick
on their hands, she would be apt to fare ill, for they
had little medicine at command.</p>
<p>While she was thus engaged, captain and mate were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
reclining on the ground, in the shade of the palm-trees.
They spoke only now and then, but there was
a peculiar expression on their faces as they watched
the schooner gradually disappearing in the distance,
for it was a long while in sight. The time came at
last, however, when even their straining vision could
not detect the faintest resemblance to a sail in the
horizon, though it was still visible, as a matter of
course, through their glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe she is gone,&#8221; said Storms, looking toward
the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I see nothing of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s about time to shake.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two brawny hands clasped, and the friends
greeted each other with remarkable cordiality; and,
as they did so, they laughed heartily, and the mate
almost shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Captain, but it was a good trick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it was; and I give you the credit of inventing
it. I never would have thought of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shake again; and now to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate had deposited some of the oysters brought
up on the bank, and they were carefully opened.
They were eight in number, and there was not found
a single pearl among them.</p>
<p>In all probability the entire lot which were carried
away upon the schooner were not worth as much as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
the same quantity of bivalves from Chesapeake Bay.
In short, this was not the pearl-oyster bed which
had brought the two friends the greater part of the
way around the globe. Suspecting&ndash;&ndash;or, rather, knowing&ndash;&ndash;the
evil intentions of the mutineers, Abe Storms
proposed the ruse, by which the visit was made to the
wrong place. The mutineers themselves were outwitted,
and, under the belief that they were carrying
away a cargo of fabulous wealth, they did not wait
to make an examination of the mollusks until they
were well out to sea.</p>
<p>When they should open and examine them they
were not likely to suspect the trick, but would think
that the whole journey was a failure, and the three
left on the island were, in reality, worse off than
themselves.</p>
<p>And yet the true bed of oyster-pearls remained to
be visited.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possible they may suspect something and
come back again,&#8221; said the mate, &#8220;but it is hardly
probable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are they likely to send any friends to take us
off?&#8221; asked the captain, with a quizzical look.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to any great extent. They will be sure to give
us as wide a berth hereafter as possible. In the meantime,
I propose that we investigate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two rose to their feet, and, lugging the armor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
between them, moved off toward a point whose location
was as well known to them as if they had spent
years upon the atoll.</p>
<p>While they were thus walking, the mate, who was
much the better-educated man, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This pearl-hunting is a curious business. Those
specimens that I brought up were the genuine species,
and yet they have very few or no pearls among them.
It must be because the conditions are not favorable for
their creation or development, while, at the place we
are about to visit, the mollusks are the same, and yet
there are conditions existing there which cause an
abnormal growth of the precious jewels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you make a careful examination of those other
oysters?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. As I told you, they are genuine, but they
have no pearls of any account, the conditions being
unfavorable for their formation. You know the
pearls grow within the oysters, being composed of
slimy secretions deposited around some foreign substance
that enters them. It may be that a peculiar
action of the tide drives a grain of sand into the mollusks,
where we are to visit&ndash;&ndash;though that is all conjecture.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mate Storms, who was only fairly launched
out in the discourse upon pearls, was here interrupted
by the captain exclaiming:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>&#8220;This must be the spot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The particular bank had been designated so clearly
that there could be no mistake, and had the chart, or
map, fallen into the hands of the mutineers, they
would have discovered the trick played on them in an
instant. The spot was a peculiar one where the two
friends stopped. Instead of being partly landlocked
like the other, it opened out fairly upon the sea, and
appeared to be entirely unprotected from the force of
the breakers, which boomed against the beach.</p>
<p>It would have been supposed naturally that the true
course was for the fishermen to go out in a small boat,
and make their explorations from that, but Grebbens
had instructed the captain that the formation was so
peculiar that nothing would be gained by this course.
The shore sank like the side of a wall to a considerable
depth, and the oysters lay on the bottom, with some
clusters clinging to the rocks, where they could be
torn off like sponges.</p>
<p>It can be understood that the work of removing
these would be almost impossible for any one excepting
a professional diver, unless, as was the case with
our friends, he should have some artificial assistance.
But for the diving-armor, it is hardly possible that
Abe Storms would have made a serious attempt to secure
anything, knowing the danger from sharks, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
the difficulty of retaining his breath for any extended
time below the surface of the water.</p>
<p>It was near the middle of the afternoon when this
spot was reached. The sea was calm, but there were
signs in the sky ominous of a coming storm, so that
the two were anxious to make a beginning without any
unnecessary delay. Stooping almost upon their faces,
when the swell had receded enough to permit them,
they peered down into the crystal depths, and caught
shadowy glimpses of the prizes. They saw the craggy
clusters, big and brown, clinging to the rocks, while
others were outlined on the floor of the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re there, beyond a doubt,&#8221; said Storms, &#8220;and
it now remains to see whether they are worth the
gathering. Help me get on this suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both worked deftly, and it was soon adjusted. The
main thing was the breathing apparatus, Storms having
some fear that at such a depth the pressure would
be so great as to close the pipes, and thus shut out
the air. However, the only way to learn was by experiment,
and he did not wait. Carefully coiling his
pipe, he took the rope in his hand and began descending,
the two having arranged the signals so that with
ordinary care no accident need result. Captain Bergen
held one end of the rope in his hand, ready to
draw his friend to the surface the instant he should
receive notice that it was necessary.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It is a long way to the bottom!&#8221; exclaimed the captain,
standing like the harpooner in a whale-boat, and
saw the line steadily paying out.</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do for him to go much further,&#8221; was his
conclusion, noticing, with some alarm, that but little
more of the hose was left on the ground. &#8220;I wish
those pearls had fixed themselves not quite&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew from the instant cessation of the weight
on the rope, and the motionless condition of the hose,
that the bottom had been reached by Abe Storms, and
none too soon, either. Peering carefully into the clear
depths, Captain Bergen saw, too, that his mate was
attending to business.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>AT LAST</h3>
</div>
<p>Mate Storms, so far as could be seen, looked like
an immense crab at work on the bottom of the pearl
bank and along the rough rocks. He was so far below
the surface that he was insensible to the long, heavy
swells, which at intervals broke upon the beach with a
thunderous boom, and so long as the breathing apparatus
kept right he could pursue his labor without
difficulty.</p>
<p>As he anticipated, he had not been long at work
when several sharks made their appearance and reconnoitered
the mysterious intruder upon their domains.
They were evidently puzzled over the appearance of
the strange visitor, and when Storms gave one of
them an ugly prod with the point of his knife, he
darted out of sight, instantly followed by the others,
who seemed to suspect they were in danger from the
monster, whose slightest touch was so emphatic.</p>
<p>It did not take long for the diver to fill his basket,
and when he gave the signal, Captain Bergen pulled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
with might and main, and, a few minutes after, the
man in his armor scrambled upon shore, tumbled over
by a huge swell, which broke at that moment. The
basket was full, and catching it up, Captain Bergen
left his friend to himself and began hurriedly prying
open the mollusks with his sheath-knife. His heart
throbbed, for they were the largest oysters he had
ever seen, and he was full of high hope.</p>
<p>The first bivalve opened disclosed a pearl almost as
large as a robin&#8217;s egg. It possessed the faint yellowish
tinge which is recognized in the East as belonging to
the most valuable species.</p>
<p>With trembling, eager hands, Captain Bergen
opened the second, and discovered another, nearly as
large as the first. Half beside himself, he snatched
up the largest oyster in the heap, and forced it apart
with such precipitancy that he cut his hand. There
lay a pearl before him fully a third larger than the
first, with the purest tint, oval in form, and worth
thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen could contain himself no longer,
but springing to his feet he threw his hat in the air,
and shouted, and danced about like a madman.</p>
<p>Mr. Storms did not remove his armor, for he intended
to go down again. His laugh, muffled and
sounding strangely from within the visor, was heard
as he joined in the demonstrations of his companion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span></div>
<p>When, encumbered as he was with his awkward armor,
he began executing a double shuffle on the beach,
the sight was so grotesque that the captain came near
going into convulsions. But the exercise was too exhausting,
and the mate speedily sat down on the shore
and also began opening oysters. His ardor was somewhat
dampened when he failed to discover anything
in the first, and he became quite solemn when the second
was equally barren of results; but the third
yielded a beautiful pearl, fully equal to the first which
the captain brought forth. There could be no doubt
now that the men had struck a pearl bank of marvelous
richness.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are plenty more down there,&#8221; said the mate,
preparing to descend with his knife and basket again.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen allowed him to go, while he took
the rope in hand, restraining his excitement with difficulty,
for he was now sure that the wildest dreams
in which he had indulged promised to be more than
realized, and he considered the fortune of himself and
friend assured.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fools,&#8221; he muttered, referring to the mutineers;
&#8220;if they had acted the part of honest men they
might have shared this, but they chose to be scoundrels,
and truly they have had their reward.&#8221;</p>
<p>He noticed this time that the mate drew more upon
the hose than before&ndash;&ndash;so much so, indeed, that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
threatened to draw the upper ends under water&ndash;&ndash;and
the captain gave a warning tug at the rope, to apprise
him that he must venture no further. The warning
was heeded, and when, a few minutes later, the diver
was helped to terra firma again, his basket was filled
heaping full.</p>
<p>This was dumped out, and he prepared to descend
once more. Captain Bergen was so occupied in attending
to his friend that he gained little time to open the
oysters, and could only look longingly at them. Now
and then, while the diver was cautiously working below,
the captain snatched one up and pried the shells
apart, and the success he met with was enough to turn
the head of the coolest and most unconcerned of men.
Beyond question, as we have said, the bank contained
oysters of astonishing richness, fully three-fourths
possessing pearls of extraordinary size and value.</p>
<p>Abe Storms went down and came up with the basket
heaped to the top six separate times, and then
doffed his armor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked the captain, in
surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! are there no more?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not another one, so far as I can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; observed the captain, in a tone
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
of disappointment. &#8220;I supposed there was enough
to keep us employed several days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Jack,&#8221; replied the mate, in a reproving tone,
&#8220;see the emptiness of riches, and how little they can
do to satisfy the cravings of the human heart. There
is enough wealth there at your feet to make you and
me independently rich for life, and yet you complain
because you have so little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was wrong,&#8221; said the captain, meekly. &#8220;I am
in such a nervous condition that I&#8217;m hardly myself.
I am truly grateful for what we have here, and glad
that we made the long voyage to secure them. We
have enough&ndash;&ndash;to crave more is wicked.&#8221;</p>
<p>They now set to work opening the shells between
which were nestling the pearls, and the result was
simply astonishing. It was hard work to get some of
the thick, ridgy bivalves apart, but when they succeeded
they rarely failed to be rewarded munificently.
Some of the pearls were small, the majority large,
and about twenty of enormous size and clearness.
When the entire lot was placed in a little pile, there
were found to be one hundred and twenty-odd; and,
although it was impossible to estimate their value,
Mate Storms&ndash;&ndash;who was the better informed&ndash;&ndash;believed
they were worth at least a quarter of a million of dollars.
All these had been taken in a few hours, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
the preparations and the voyage thither had occupied
many long, long months.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I will go down and take a farewell look,&#8221;
said Abe, when the task was finished. &#8220;I have a suspicion
that I may have missed something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am quite sure you have,&#8221; replied the captain,
assisting him with his armor; &#8220;and you have but a
short time at your disposal, either, for I think a storm
is brewing.&#8221;</p>
<p>This time the mate meant to proceed differently.
In descending along the rocks the first time, he paused
to break off some of the clusters, and he thought he
caught the shadowy glimpse of an enormous oyster,
further in; but there were so many closer at hand,
and he was so excited&ndash;&ndash;despite his natural coolness&ndash;&ndash;that
he forgot about it until now, when he determined
to look further, half hoping, more than believing, that
it might possess a still larger pearl than any he had
seen. He was confident that this was the only one
he had missed, for the search he made during his last
descent, in other respects, was thorough and left nothing
to be done over again.</p>
<p>Carefully he sank into the depths of the ocean, with
one hand grasping the rope, ready to give the signal
to stop lowering the instant it should become necessary.
He passed several yawning crevices in the
rocks, which, of course, were of coral formation, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
all at once he tugged smartly at the rope. He recognized
the spot, and his feet were still about three
yards from the bank upon which he had walked back
and forth so many times. Captain Bergen responded
at once, and held him suspended where he was, which
was anything but a comfortable position, inasmuch as
he could find no support for his feet, and his left hand
was of little use.</p>
<p>Immediately before his face the rock made an inward
sweep, showing an abrupt ledge, a yard in width
and depth. Scanning this as closely as he could in
the dim twilight of the ocean-cavern, Storms thought
he saw something resembling an oyster, which was
fully a foot in length. Uncertain as to its identity,
he shoved his hand in and found it was suspended to
the rock above, and after two or three violent
wrenches, and by using his knife as well as he could,
he broke it loose and drew it out.</p>
<p>It was an oyster, indeed, of prodigious size, and he
instantly signaled to the captain to draw him up. The
latter did so with a vigor that threatened to dislocate
the armor itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here it is,&#8221; he exclaimed, the moment he reached
the air. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know whether there is anything
in it or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My stars! Is that an oyster?&#8221; asked the captain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
picking it up and turning it over like a huge stone,
with inquiring eyes.</p>
<p>Little Inez Hawthorne had come to the spot while
the mate was down the last time, and she danced with
delight at the sight of the beautiful pearls piled upon
the ground like a heap of tiny cannon balls.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with that?&#8221; she asked,
surveying the big bivalve, with an expression of disgust
on her pretty face.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is yours,&#8221; said the captain, earnestly.</p>
<p>The mate looked at him and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that, captain?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. Whatever we find inside of that shall be
consecrated to the use of Inez Hawthorne&ndash;&ndash;to be hers
absolutely. There may be nothing at all, but if there
be a pearl, it will possess a value which we cannot
estimate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate reached out his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;The proposition does credit to your heart, captain,
and I join it without reservation. Now do you
open it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain hesitated a moment and looked at the
big shell curiously, as if afraid to make the investigation.</p>
<p>While thus employed, Storms called attention to the
fact that the two shells were already slightly separated,
as if the mollusk were gasping for air, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
could not be the case. Captain Bergen held up the
huge shell and peeped inside. He did so but an instant,
when he dropped it upon the sand, and exclaimed,
with a pale face and trembling voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s there!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mate Storms knew what it meant, and he in turn
raised the oyster, ran his knife in carefully, worked
hard for a minute, and then managed to get the two
shells apart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>THE PEARL OF THE PACIFIC</h3>
</div>
<p>There, at the front of the oyster, and slightly to
one side, was the most marvelous pearl upon which
the eyes of the men had ever rested. It was the size
of an ordinary hen&#8217;s egg, clear and pure, and worth
a sum of money which neither of the astounded men
dared attempt to guess.</p>
<p>For a few seconds they were speechless, and then
Inez clapped her hands with delight, and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is yours,&#8221; replied Captain Bergen. &#8220;The
mate and I give it to you, to be yours and no one&#8217;s
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it splendid?&#8221; cried Inez, catching it up,
passing it from one hand to the other, holding it up in
the sunlight, and showing as much genuine pleasure as
if she were a veritable South Sea Islander, presented
with some new trinket.</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; said Mate Storms, &#8220;may be called The
Pearl of the Pacific!&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; objected the captain, &#8220;it is she who is the
pearl of this great ocean, for it was upon its surface
that we first saw her, and she has proved herself far
above the worth of pearls or diamonds or rubies. To
her, under heaven, my life, and not impossibly yours,
is owing. The greatest pleasure of this voyage has
come from her companionship, and all that I ask now
is that we shall be able to preserve this wealth for her,
and that the opportunity may be ours to do our full
duty toward her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mate Storms looked admiringly at the captain, who
had so eloquently expressed his own sentiments.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Jack,&#8221; said he, speaking in his familiar
way. &#8220;It is she who is the Pearl of the
Pacific!&#8221;</p>
<p>The men surveyed, with the greatest pleasure, the
frolicsome delight of the little one, who was all unmindful
of the immense treasure which had fallen to
her lot, and of the title of honor which her friends had
given her. Naturally, the entire party were so absorbed
that for a time they hardly glanced beyond
their immediate surroundings; but when Abe Storms
came up for the last time, he glanced, by the merest
accident, out to sea, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my goodness! Just look there, Jack!&#8221;</p>
<p>No more than half a mile distant, a flying proa was
seen, speeding with great swiftness over the water,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
while a number of dark figures were discovered on the
deck, evidently looking with no little curiosity at the
white men.</p>
<p>The singular craft, however, came no nearer, and
soon vanished in the distance. Its appearance caused
some apprehension and uneasiness on the part of our
friends, and after discussing the matter they decided,
as a matter of precaution, to bury the pearls.</p>
<p>Inez was persuaded, without difficulty, to trust hers
to the keeping of her friends, who dug a small well in
the sand, and inclosing the entire number of pearls
in strong canvas bags, made for that purpose, buried
them out of sight, there to remain until one or both of
the men should choose to dig them up again, and it
was agreed that that should not be done until the
way opened for them to leave the island.</p>
<p>The long afternoon was well advanced when this
task was completed, they fixing the precise spot so
clearly in their minds that there was no necessity of
landmarks, either being sure of finding it whenever it
should become necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me the swells are larger than usual,
and they make more noise when they break upon the
beach,&#8221; observed Mr. Storms, looking curiously at the
sky.</p>
<p>They had just dumped back the remains of the
pearl-oysters into the sea, so as to leave no trace of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
their work, and Captain Bergen straightened up and
surveyed the sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a storm coming&ndash;&ndash;a regular screamer!
Look, by the great horn spoon!&#8221; he added, in no little
excitement.</p>
<p>There was good cause for the emotion of the captain,
for the light of the sun was obscured by a thick,
yellow haze, which was fast overspreading the sky,
and, far out to sea, the long line of mist seemed to
be churning the water into foam, and to be advancing
rapidly toward the island, where stood the two men
contemplating the coming fury of the elements.</p>
<p>The light of the sun was obscured, and there was
a perceptible chilliness in the air, and the barometer&ndash;&ndash;which
they had brought from the <i>Coral</i>&ndash;&ndash;showed
a most startling change. One of the fiercest of the
tropical tempests was gathering, and was sure to break
upon the island in a few minutes.</p>
<p>This was alarming to contemplate, for the men
knew well what kind of elemental disturbances spring
up on the shortest notice in the South Seas. But it
was not this alone which startled them.</p>
<p>Looking directly out to sea, toward the yeasty
waters, they saw a schooner sinking and rising upon
the long swells, and certain to be caught, in the very
vortex, as may be said, of the hurricane, or tornado,
or typhoon, or whatever it should be termed. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
craft was not an unfamiliar one&ndash;&ndash;both knew it well&ndash;&ndash;for
it was the <i>Coral</i>, with the mutineers on board.</p>
<p>Unarmed as they were, they would not dare place
themselves in the power of those toward whom they
had shown such enmity, but that they were literally
forced to do so to escape almost certain destruction
from the impending tempest.</p>
<p>If they should run into the lagoon to wait until the
storm should subside, neither the captain nor mate
would disturb them&ndash;&ndash;provided they took their departure
as soon as it became safe. Still, knowing their
treacherous character so well, Bergen and Storms did
not mean to trust them at all. Inez was therefore
placed within the cabin, while her protectors made
certain they were armed and ready for any contingency.</p>
<p>Now that the sun was shut out from sight, a darkness
like that of night overspread land and water,
while the strong gale howled among the palms, which
swayed and bent as if they would soon be uprooted
and flung out into the boiling sea. The swells were
topped with foam, and large drops of rain, sweeping
almost horizontally across the island, struck against
the face like pebbles.</p>
<p>The mutineers were heading, so far as was possible,
towards the opening in the atoll, but they were not in
position to strike it, and, with the deepening darkness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
and increasing tempest, the task was becoming more
difficult every minute. Suddenly a vivid flash of lightning
illumined the gloom, and the schooner <i>Coral</i> was
observed on the crest of a high wave, heading toward
the island; but the two men who saw her, saw also,
that she missed the opening and was too close in to
make it.</p>
<p>The rumble of thunder continued for some minutes,
when once more a blinding flash swept across the
murky sky, lighting up sea and island for the instant,
as if with the glare of the noonday sun. Captain Bergen
and Mate Storms were straining their eyes to
catch sight of the little schooner and its crew, but it
was invisible. In that single searching glance, they
could not have failed to see her had she been afloat.
The conclusion, therefore, was inevitable. She and
her crew had gone to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Such was the fact. The mutineers had met a
frightful though merited fate, and could trouble our
friends no more.</p>
<hr class='toprule' />

<a name='CHAPTER_XXIII_A_DISMAL_HOME' id='CHAPTER_XXIII_A_DISMAL_HOME'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>A DISMAL HOME</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Bergen and his mate were not certain
that one or more of the mutineers had not survived
the foundering of the schooner <i>Coral</i>, and had managed
to reach the island.</p>
<p>If such were the case, they considered it important
that it should be known as soon as possible, and on
the morrow, therefore, they made careful search, but
none of the three men was ever seen again. A few
fragments of spars, floating here and there, were all
the signs that such a craft had ever sailed over the
Pacific.</p>
<p>Since the captain and mate were now given the
opportunity to think of their own situation, they did
so like men of gravity and sense. They were safely
upon Pearl Island, as they had named it. They had
secured the prize for which they had come so many
thousand miles, and they were, as the world goes,
wealthy men. More than that, they had found a pearl
of such marvelous size and purity that, being dedicated
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
to little Inez Hawthorne, it was a great fortune
indeed to her.</p>
<p>And yet, in one sense, the little party were paupers;
that is, so long as they were held prisoners upon
the atoll, for the treasure of pearls could not purchase
them food, clothing, friends, happiness&ndash;&ndash;nor, in fact,
were they anything more than so many valueless pebbles.
They must reach civilization again to realize
anything from the riches which had come into their
possession.</p>
<p>But how were they to leave the island? This was
the one great question which faced them, and which
they were called upon to solve, for now that there was
no further cause for staying, the homesickness of the
men increased, and it was not long before they felt
they would give half their wealth for the means of getting
back to Boston.</p>
<p>Since they were absolutely without this means, it
was evident they could do nothing but rely upon Providence
to send some vessel to their relief. It was not
impossible that Abe Storms, gifted as he was with so
much wonderful ingenuity, might have attempted to
construct some sort of craft from the palm trees, and
it is quite likely he would have succeeded in making
something that could be utilized. But the awful blotting
out of the <i>Coral</i>, before their eyes, had alarmed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
both, and made them more timid than they otherwise
would have been.</p>
<p>It was a good many miles to the nearest inhabited
island, as laid down on their chart, and they might
succeed in reaching it, provided they could be assured
of a week of good weather. But there could be no such
assurance, and a disturbance meant the same fate that
overtook the mutineers.</p>
<p>It is not at all unlikely, too, that the presence of
little Inez Hawthorne increased this timidity. Had
they been without her, they would not have hesitated
to take great risks, but, somehow or other, her life was
inestimably precious in their eyes, and they would
never have forgiven themselves had any ill befallen
her through their dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a mystery about her life which shall yet
be cleared up,&#8221; Abe Storms frequently remarked;
&#8220;and we must not do aught that shall endanger or delay
the solution of the question.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were comparatively few stores which the
schooner had left them before its final departure, and
the survivors were forced to rely mainly upon what
the island afforded. Of course there were fish in
abundance, and they frequently rowed out in the
lagoon in the tender, or small boat, or cast out their
lines from shore, and never failed in a short time to
catch all they wanted.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>The spring of clear, cool water bubbled and trickled
steadily, and never failed them. And the several
species of tropical fruits about them were used sparingly,
the men having the prudence to seek to prevent
the supply giving out.</p>
<p>It was a great relief to Storms and Bergen to find,
after the most thorough exploration they could make,
that there were no poisonous reptiles upon the island.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may as well face the situation,&#8221; said Captain
Bergen, after they had held frequent consultations;
&#8220;we have been here five weeks now, and we haven&#8217;t
caught sight of the first sail, with the exception of
our own, which has gone to the bottom, and it may be
that weeks and months more may pass before we shall
see another.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not unlikely that it may be years,&#8221; added
Storms, gravely; &#8220;for, according to the narrative of
Grebbens himself, he was here a long time before he
was taken away. The wisest thing we can do is to prepare
ourselves for an indefinite stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>A long time before, the captain had laboriously
climbed the mast which was erected in the sand by the
inlet, and had securely fastened an old garment to the
highest point. There it was still, fluttering in the
wind, when there was enough breeze to raise the irregular
folds, but, alas! it had not brought the friendly
sail which they longed for, and they had been forced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
at last to look upon an extended residence upon the
island as not only possible, but very probable.</p>
<p>Like philosophers, they governed themselves accordingly.
The signal was kept flying and they busied
themselves fishing, talking or doing odd things which
were done simply to pass away time. But the two
felt that a most urgent duty was upon them, respecting
Inez Hawthorne.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must do what we can for her,&#8221; said Storms.
&#8220;With the material which I have on hand we can construct
garments that will keep her clad with comeliness,
though she may not be in the fashion; and yet
I don&#8217;t know but what she will,&#8221; he added, with a
smile, &#8220;for we may strike some of the vagaries without
knowing it. Then, too, she must be educated.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not well up in the line of an education,&#8221; said
the captain, with some embarrassment, &#8220;being as I
never attended any other than a district school, but I
believe you graduated, didn&#8217;t you, Abe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I went through Harvard three years ago, and
stood second in my class. I haven&#8217;t any fear that I
won&#8217;t be able to teach her, for she is a child of unusual
brightness.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, as may be supposed, the mate went to work
thoroughly in the instruction of Inez Hawthorne, who
proved herself one of the most apt of pupils, and advanced
with a rapidity which delighted her teacher.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THREE YEARS</h3>
</div>
<p>Three years have passed, and still Captain Bergen,
Mate Storms and Inez Hawthorne are upon the lonely
Pearl Island in the South Sea.</p>
<p>Could they have believed when they left Boston
that they would be doomed to such an imprisonment,
it may well be doubted whether they would have made
the voyage, even if assured of the vast fortune which
thereby came into their hands.</p>
<p>The three years had been dismally monotonous to
them, and their courage had been tried to the utmost,
for there had been times when both agreed that they
would probably stay there until released by death,
and then they fell to speculating as to which would
be the last one to survive. According to human logic,
it would seem that that lot would fall to Inez, and
their hearts sank at the thought of her being left to
perish in the lonely spot.</p>
<p>When the coat fluttering from the top of the mast
was blown away by the gale, Captain Bergen climbed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
up and nailed another in its place, grimly remarking
that it looked as if they were going down with their
colors flying.</p>
<p>It was surprising what was done by Mate Storms,
whose ingenuity was almost incredible. With the material
at his command, he kept Inez clothed in a tasteful
manner.</p>
<p>She wore dresses and shoes which fitted her well,
and her hat was renewed with extraordinary skill,
from material obtained from the palm-trees.</p>
<p>Those three years, although of indescribable weariness
at times, were marked by some startling incidents,
and by many worthy of record. The great object
of Storms was to educate Inez, and he did his utmost
in that direction, assisted by the bright intellect
of the girl and her own ardent desire to explore the
wonders of knowledge.</p>
<p>There were few facilities in the way of furniture,
considered so indispensable in these later days. He
had no pens or ink, and only a Bible in the way of
books. He had some blank paper and a single lead
pencil, which were utilized to their fullest extent.
For a slate or blackboard, he used the beach, as did
Archimedes of the olden time.</p>
<p>Selecting a place where the water had left it hard
and smooth, Storms, with a sharp-pointed stick, made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
his characters and gave his instruction in the mysteries
of mathematics.</p>
<p>It would sound incredible were we to say that, during
those three years, the dwellers on the lonely atoll
had never descried a sail; and such was not a fact, for
there are few shores on this globe where a human
being can bury himself so long from sight of the
white-winged birds of commerce. They had seen
many ships, but it looked very much as if they themselves
had not been seen, nor had their presence been
suspected by any of them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea of our being so nervous lest some one
should get here ahead of us,&#8221; remarked Storms, more
than once, &#8220;when we might have delayed our coming
a dozen years without any danger from that cause.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had discovered the cloud-like picture of the
canvas sail as it came up over the horizon, and their
hearts swelled as it expanded and came closer. But
all hope faded again when it grew less in the distance
and finally passed from view altogether.</p>
<p>This had happened repeatedly, and more than once
Captain Bergen had laboriously made his way up the
smooth mast to the very top, where he swung his hat
wildly; but it must have been that the little island in
the South Seas possessed slight interest in the eyes of
the navigators who occasionally drifted in that direction,
for had they seen the signal of distress, or caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
sight of the man frantically waving his hat from the
top, they would have learned what its meaning was.</p>
<p>The greatest dejection which took possession of the
couple was when they, through the glass, saw the Stars
and Stripes fluttering from the mizzen of the ship
which came the nearest and then made off again. The
sight of that most beautiful banner in the world was
like a glimpse of their distant New England home,
and they seemed to feel the cool breeze fanning their
hot brows as it bore steadily toward them.</p>
<p>When it went over the convex sea out of sight, Captain
Bergen covered his face with his hands and wept,
and when, after awhile, he looked up again, he saw
the tears on the cheeks of Abe Storms, who stood motionless
and gazing silently off upon the deep, as if he
expected the vessel would come back to them. It was
a severe blow, and it was a long time before they
recovered from it.</p>
<p>The exact age of Inez Hawthorne when she became,
by an extraordinary turn of the wheel of fortune, the
prot&eacute;g&eacute;e of the two sailors, was, as given by herself,
six years, but both the captain and mate were confident
that she was fully one, if not two years older.</p>
<p>Now, at the termination of the period named, she
was a girl as fully developed mentally and physically
as one of a dozen years, and she was growing into a
woman of striking beauty. She was still a child, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
all the innocence and simplicity which distinguished
her at the time she was taken from the deck of the
steamer <i>Polynesia</i>, but in a few years more, should
she be spared, she would become a woman.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen and Mate Storms were honest, conscientious
men, and Christians, and they performed
their full duty in that most important respect to Inez
Hawthorne. Never passed a day in which Storms
did not read, in an impressive voice, from the great
Book of all books, and the sublime passages, the wonderful
precepts, the divine truths and the sacred instruction
from that volume were seed which fell upon
good ground and bore its fruit in due season.</p>
<p>If ever there was a good, pure, devout Christian,
Inez Hawthorne became one, and her greatest desire,
as she repeatedly expressed it, was that she might go
out in the great world among all people, and do her
utmost to carry the glad tidings to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;The time will come,&#8221; replied Abe Storms, when
he listened to these glowing wishes. &#8220;God never intended
you should live and die upon this lonely island
when there is such need for missionaries like you. I
don&#8217;t see that we are of much account, but I believe
He has something for us, too, and we shall be given
the opportunity to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; said the skipper, with a sigh, &#8220;you have been
saying that for three years, and the sails that come go
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
again and care nothing for us. I am beginning to believe
we are to stay here for the rest of our lives, and
that I am to be the first one to take the long, last
sleep that awaits us all.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXV_AN_ARRIVAL' id='CHAPTER_XXV_AN_ARRIVAL'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>AN ARRIVAL</h3>
</div>
<p>When Captain Bergen was inclined to become pessimistic,
the mate treated it lightly, for he feared the
strong sailor would break before long from sheer
homesickness.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that neither had any family, the
mate being one of those who are without any close living
relative, while the captain had a sister in New
England, and his aged mother was in San Francisco,
living with a nephew, of whom she was very fond.</p>
<p>Thus the three years passed away, and the second
era in their lives approached. There was something
curious in the fact that all the inhabitants of the
lonely Pearl Island had lost their reckoning. No two
could agree on the day of the week, and when they
compromised on one, which was called Sunday, and
observed as such, they were much in doubt whether
they were right, and, as it afterward proved, they
were not.</p>
<p>One afternoon, when the sun had hardly passed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
the meridian, the mate and captain were stretched
upon the beach under the shade of a palm-tree, and
looking out upon the sea, over which they had come
to this desolate spot so long before. The day was
cooler than usual, and a steady breeze blew, rendering
the position of the friends in that respect as pleasant
as they could wish, though their weary, homesick feeling
was telling upon them. Both the ragged sailors
were thinner, and there was a yearning, far-away look
in their eyes, especially in those of the captain, which
presaged the approach of insanity or death at no distant
day, unless a change were made in their condition
and surroundings. This lamentable state was partly
due, no doubt, to the diet to which they had been subjected
for many months.</p>
<p>Inez, who seemed happy everywhere and at all
times, was busying herself in the cabin, where she
could find plenty to do; and ever and anon the sound
of her voice could be heard, as she sang some snatch
of song, which came through the mist of memory from
her infancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what it is,&#8221; said Captain Bergen, in his
low, determined voice, &#8220;this thing cannot continue
much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are no more weary of it than I, Jack; but
show me the way in which it can be ended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to take the risk. The tender there is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
large enough to carry us and a good supply of provisions&ndash;&ndash;that
is, enough water, to last several days. We
can rig some sort of sail, and, in less than a week, by
keeping to the northwest, we shall reach some inhabited
island, unless we should be picked up before that
time, which I consider quite likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought a good deal of it, Jack,&#8221; said the
mate, in a voice of equal seriousness. &#8220;We have been
restrained heretofore by the fear that it would endanger
too greatly the safety of Inez, and mainly by
the feeling that we couldn&#8217;t stay here long without assistance
being summoned by that signal fluttering up
there. And yet, three years have come and gone,&#8221; continued
the mate, &#8220;and not a living soul has come to us.
There have been hundreds of days within this long
period when we might have embarked on board the
little boat and safely made our way to some other
port, but we could not know it, and the result is&ndash;&ndash;here
we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the situation is very different from what it
was when we first landed, for it is now a choice between
staying here with the certainty of miserably
perishing&ndash;&ndash;every one of us&ndash;&ndash;and of starting boldly
out upon an unknown sea, as it may be called, with
the chances between life and death about even.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have stated the case correctly,&#8221; assented Mr.
Storms; &#8220;and though it is your place to command, yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
as you have deferred to me, I give you my promise
that to-morrow we shall begin rigging the best sort of
sail we can, and at daylight on the next day we will
start for whatever port Providence directs us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That has put new life into me, Abe. I feel now as
I did three years ago, when we first caught sight of
those pearls. I am ten years younger. I prefer a
bold stroke for life to a weak submission to fate, with
this dismal waiting for help to come to us. By the
great horn spoon! a thousand such pearl banks as we
cleaned out wouldn&#8217;t tempt me to spend another year
on this hated island&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>At this instant the voice of Inez was heard, excitedly
calling to them, and while they rose to the
sitting position and looked inquiringly in that direction,
she was seen to spring through the open door of
the cabin, and to come running toward them on the
beach, bareheaded and with her long, yellow hair
streaming in the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;What can be the matter with her?&#8221; exclaimed the
captain, rising to his feet. &#8220;What is she saying?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hark!&#8221;</p>
<p>The distance was so short that the girl was at their
side a second or two later. She was laughing, and
uttering something in her excitement, which, until
that moment, they did not understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who ever saw any one so stupid?&#8221; she called out,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
cheerily. &#8220;What are your eyes for? Why don&#8217;t you
look out to sea?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two obeyed, and an exclamation of amazement
escaped both, for there, while they had lain on
the beach talking in such disconsolate tones, and looking
dreamily out upon the ocean, a craft had been
steadily approaching, and neither of the two saw it.</p>
<p>At the furthest, it was no more than a mile distant,
and, since it was heading straight in toward the atoll,
the chances were a hundred to one that the signal of
distress had been seen, and the lonely island at last
was going to have a visitor.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen muttered something about the
&#8220;great horn spoon,&#8221; under his breath, while Storms
said nothing, but gazed steadily at the craft, upon
which his hopes were so suddenly and strongly fixed.
It might be that the hearts of all three bounded
with hope at this sight of a vessel, but the hope was
mixed with apprehension, for the sailors saw it was
not the sort of vessel for which they had been praying
so long.</p>
<p>Instead of a gallant ship, with the Stars and Stripes
streaming from the fore, it was what is termed a
flying proa, which is the name applied to the narrow
canoes used principally in the Ladrone Islands. They
are about thirty feet long, three feet wide, and are
steered by a paddle at either end. The sail is lateen,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
with a boom upon one mast; the prow and stern curve
to a high point, and the depth being considerably
greater than the width, the proa would, if unsupported,
capsize instantly, but a hollow log or heavy-pointed
spar rests on the water, parallel with the windward
side, and, being secured in place, acts as an outrigger
and removes the danger of overturning. The
same name is applied to the boats used by the Malays,
and which are propelled by both oars and sails.</p>
<p>But the one which greeted the astonished eyes of
Storms and Bergen had its huge lateen sail spread,
and was moving with great velocity, for the proas of
the Indian and Pacific oceans are probably the fastest
boats in the world. It rode the waters like a bird, and
would soon enter the lagoon within the island, for
there could be no doubt that the men on board had
seen not only the signal, but the persons themselves
who were waiting for them.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as a couple of men were discernible with
the naked eye on the proa, it followed that the latter
must descry the three individuals who were standing
out in full view upon the shore of the island.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about this?&#8221; asked Captain Bergen, stepping
to the side of his mate, and speaking in an undertone.
&#8220;Shall we rejoice or not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s uncertain,&#8221; was the dubious reply. &#8220;Those
boats generally carry the vagabonds of the ocean, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the last motive which, as a rule, brings them to a spot
like this is humanity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your glass?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare, I never thought of that&ndash;&ndash;I was so surprised!&#8221;</p>
<p>Storms carried it with him always, and he now
brought it to bear upon the singular-looking craft
approaching. It was so close inshore that, with the
aid of the instrument, he was able to see everything
distinctly, especially as the boat at that moment bore
off a little and then headed toward the entrance again.</p>
<p>So far as could be ascertained, there were three persons
on the boat, and the captain reached the same conclusion
after using the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; said Captain Bergen, &#8220;we
haven&#8217;t anything to fear from them, for, with our guns
and ammunition, we can hold our own against a dozen
South Sea Islanders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There may be others concealed about the craft, but
I incline to think not. However, it&#8217;s best to be prepared.
So let&#8217;s get to the house and make ready to
receive them&ndash;&ndash;whether they come as enemies or
friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suggestion was a prudent one, and the two men
hurried up the beach in the direction of the cabin,
while Inez remained to watch the proa. The men
examined their rifles and saw they were loaded and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
ready for instant use, and then, bearing one apiece,
they came forth again. As they did so, something like
a shadow seemed to shoot through the trees, and, looking
toward the lagoon, they saw the cause. The proa
had entered the quiet waters within, and was coming
to rest as gracefully as a sea gull stops in its flight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE FLYING PROA AND ITS COMMANDER</h3>
</div>
<p>The lateen sail of the proa descended with a rattle
and bang, the man at the oar gave it several vigorous
sweeps, and the strange-looking but astonishingly
swift craft came to rest almost in the same position
that the schooner <i>Coral</i> occupied three years before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Helloa, there! How are you? How long have
you been here?&#8221;</p>
<p>When it is stated that this hail came from aboard
the proa, it is unnecessary to say that our two friends
were surprised, for they supposed that the visitors
were natives, who at the best could not speak more
than a few words of broken English.</p>
<p>This astonishment was turned to literal amazement
when they saw that the speaker was a Caucasian like
themselves, one of the two standing at the prow, and
looking out upon them with a smiling countenance.
There was no mistaking the ruddy, sunburned face,
the curling hair, and the regular, European features
of the young man, whose expanded smile showed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
set of white, even teeth, and he seemed to enjoy their
astonishment after hearing his words.</p>
<p>It was curious that they had failed to notice him
before, inasmuch as his dress was dissimilar from the
others, he having the usual tarpaulin hat and the
broad trowsers of the American and English sailor.
It was plain, too, that he was scarcely a man, being,
in fact, a boy, who by some strange means was adrift
in this part of the world.</p>
<p>As soon as the proa was within reach of land, the
youth sprang ashore, and, walking straight up to Captain
Bergen, extended his right hand to him and his
left to Mr. Storms, shaking both warmly, while, as he
spoke, he looked from the face of one to the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been in this place? Judging
from your clothes and looks, I should say about
twenty years? Do you want to emigrate? Where are
you from? What are your names? How came
you here? My name is Fred Sanders, and I&#8217;ve been
knocking about among the South Sea Islands for the
last five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no resisting the jolly good-nature of the
young man, who had a habit of laughing heartily,
when no one else could see anything to laugh at, and
whose high spirits always infected others with whom
he came in contact. But it would not have required
much study for any one to discover that he was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
wild, reckless youth, who had probably run away
from home, and taken to bad ways from a natural
inclination in that direction.</p>
<p>While this interview was going on, Inez Hawthorne
was absent, she having withdrawn at the suggestion of
her friends, though of course the visitors knew of her
presence, from having seen her on the beach.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen replied to the greeting of his
friend:</p>
<p>&#8220;We have been here full three years. If I&#8217;m not
mistaken, it is three years and two weeks this very
Thursday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s just where you <i>are</i> mistaken!&#8221; broke
in Fred Sanders, with his ringing laugh, &#8220;for it so
happens that to-day isn&#8217;t Thursday, by a long shot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; Mr. Storms hastened to say. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know how many arguments I have had with the
captain to prove he was wrong, and that this is
Friday&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>And Fred threw back his head and roared louder
than ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a toss up between you. I don&#8217;t wonder that
you got muddled when you were forced to stay in such
an outlandish place as this so long. I think I would
have got mixed myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pray tell me what day of the week it is.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;This is Tuesday afternoon, with a half-dozen
hours of daylight left to you yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>While this brief conversation was going on, the two
natives were upon the boat, waiting as if for permission
to land. They sat as meekly as children, in a
partly crouching position, intently watching, with
their glittering black eyes, the three figures before
them. They appeared to listen with absorbing attention
to the words, as if they understood them&ndash;&ndash;which
they did not, excepting so far as they were interpreted
by the vigorous gestures.</p>
<p>Inez Hawthorne, as we have stated, had withdrawn
to the house, when requested to do so by her teacher,
but her curiosity led her to step forth and look upon
the parties and listen to the conversation&ndash;&ndash;the distance
being so short that she could hear all that was
said. The natives saw her, and so did Fred Sanders,
who occasionally glanced over the shoulders of the two
men with whom he was talking, in a way which they
understood. The visitors could not fail to be greatly
interested in her, but Fred refrained for a time from
referring to the girl.</p>
<p>Mate Storms explained that the craft in which they
came to this portion of the world was wrecked, and
that three of the crew were lost, and the captain, mate
and a single passenger saved. Since then they had
looked in vain for the coming of some friendly sail;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
plenty enough, however, having appeared, only to depart
again and leave them in greater depths of gloom
than before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; asked the captain, putting
the question directly to the young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an American, born in New England, and am
seventeen years old, and it is a long time since I have
seen my home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How came you in this part of the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not here as well as anywhere else?&#8221; asked
Fred Sanders, in reply. &#8220;I left home when I was
only ten years of age, and have knocked about the
world ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are now among the Paumotu Islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where I have been for a good while. Some time,
perhaps, I will give you the whole history, but it is
too long to tell now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was apparent, from the manner of the boy, that
he wished to conceal some facts of his previous life,
and neither the captain nor mate pressed him&ndash;&ndash;for, in
truth, it was of no special interest to them, their all-absorbing
subject of mental anxiety being as to how
they were to get away from the hated place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are you directly from?&#8221; asked Mr. Storms.</p>
<p>&#8220;From an island, the name of which I have never
heard in English, though its native name is something
like Wauparmur.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Inhabited, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. There are four or five hundred natives and
their families. The island is a dozen miles in extent,
is very fertile, and has several native towns. At one
place is a good harbor, and nearly always some foreign
vessel is there. Sometimes I have seen three or more,
and when I left, four days ago, a trading-ship from
Boston had arrived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Abe Storms. &#8220;So near and yet
so far!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it will probably stay a week longer, for
they are doing a good trade with the islanders.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have awakened a hope that is really painful,&#8221;
said Captain Bergen, while the pale face of Mr.
Storms showed he was affected fully as profoundly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why it need be painful,&#8221; said the
young man, in his off-hand manner, which was so captivating;
&#8220;for we were going on a little cruise, when
we caught sight of your signal flying, and we put in
to find out what the trouble was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And are you willing to take us off?&#8221; asked Storms,
who, while he felt the question was unnecessary, was
still trembling with anxiety lest something should prevent
their going.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will we take you off?&#8221; asked Fred, with a ringing
laugh. &#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty question to ask us, when we
came for the express purpose of doing so. Of course,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
we&#8217;ll take you straight away to the island we came
from, and, of course, we&#8217;ll put you in the way of getting
back to Boston as soon as possible, and we only
regret that we hadn&#8217;t the chance to get here three
years sooner, so as to save you this dreary waste of
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tears came to the eyes of both the men, and, as
Captain Bergen took the hand of the youth, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;We will thank you forever, and will pay you
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an unfortunate speech, and the cooler-headed
mate would never have uttered it.</p>
<p>It might result in no harm; but why let the reckless
youth know that they possessed the ability to pay
him well? It would be time enough to present him
with some of their valuable pearls after reaching
Wauparmur, when no possible complication could result
from Sanders knowing that these two ragged
sailors were very wealthy men. But the words had
been said, and could not be recalled, though a vague
uneasiness shot through the mind of Abe Storms when
he saw a sudden flash of the dark eyes of the youth,
who said, in the cheeriest of voices, slapping the captain
on the shoulder with a vigor that staggered him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Who talks of paying one for doing his simple
duty? If you or your friend repeats that insult, there
will be war between us; and then&ndash;&ndash;excuse me, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
ain&#8217;t you joking when you talk of paying well? For,
begging pardon again, you don&#8217;t look like millionaires
with a very heavy bank account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Storms trembled, but he could not restrain the
captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, we wouldn&#8217;t insult you, but you will be
remembered; and though we are not very extravagant
in the way of dress, and don&#8217;t look like very wealthy
men, yet I can promise you you shall be well recompensed,
and, what is more, we can carry out the promise,
too, in a way that will open your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having uttered these compromising words, Captain
Bergen laughed in a way which alarmed the mate
still more; for there was a peculiarity in his friend&#8217;s
actions which he had never noticed before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know we are dressed very poorly,&#8221; added the
captain, &#8220;and we wouldn&#8217;t be very popular in a drawing-room,
but if you set us down as poor men you will
make a great mistake. Won&#8217;t he, Abe&ndash;&ndash;eh, boy?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he facetiously punched the astonished and
grieved mate in the side, and danced about as if he
had perpetrated the best joke of his life.</p>
<p>Just then Storms caught the eye of Fred Sanders,
and he significantly tapped his own forehead to signify
that the captain was not exactly right, mentally.
And, when he did so, the kind-hearted mate spoke the
truth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>FRED SANDERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Captain Bergen was so affected by the joyful
awakening to the fact that his long, dismal sojourn
on the lonely island in the Pacific had reached the
end at last, and by the belief that now he would be
carried as rapidly as wind and sail could take him to
his beloved New England again, that his mind was
unsettled and he behaved in a way that pained, as
much as it astonished, his companion.</p>
<p>Inasmuch as such was the fact, Mr. Storms hoped
that it would be accepted as an explanation of the
strange utterances in which he had indulged, for he
believed that the cupidity of the young man had
already been excited, and a most unfortunate complication
threatened.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse the excitement of my friend,&#8221;
said he to Sanders, &#8220;though mine is nearly as great;
but he had almost settled into the belief that we were
doomed to perish in this desolate spot, and the reaction
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
caused by your joyous tidings is too much for
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right!&#8221; was the cheery response. &#8220;I
understand how that is. But, begging pardon, I believe
you have another companion?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred looked so earnestly at the figure of Inez Hawthorne,
standing a short distance off, that his meaning
could not be mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is I who should beg your pardon,&#8221; said Storms,
in turn, beckoning to Inez to approach; &#8220;but we were
so much interested in you that we forgot her for the
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the girl was approaching the group, Captain
Bergen turned about, and without a word, walked
slowly away in the direction of the cabin, his manner
showing still more clearly than ever that his mind was
unbalanced&ndash;&ndash;a fact which caused Storms great
discomfort. Aside from his love for the good, honest
man, he saw that he had already imperiled, and was
likely still further to imperil, their great possessions
by his rambling, and yet significant, talk.</p>
<p>The pearls still lay some distance away, buried in
the sand in their canvas bags, and must be procured
before leaving the island.</p>
<p>Since the captain had already awakened suspicion
respecting the truth, the difficulty of getting the prizes
away without detection was immeasurably increased,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
while the likelihood of his making still further disclosures
remained.</p>
<p>Storms was fearful that this sudden movement on
the part of Bergen meant something of the kind, but
the situation was such that he could not interfere, and
all he could do during the few minutes remaining of
the trying interview, was to keep a furtive watch, so
far as possible, upon the movements of the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Sanders,&#8221; said the mate, &#8220;this is Inez Hawthorne&ndash;&ndash;a
little girl who became a companion of ours
through no fault of hers or of either of us. She has
been here during the three years we have spent on
the island, and though she has stood it so much better
than we, she is fully as anxious to get away. Inez,
this is Mr. Fred Sanders, who has come to take us
off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The handsome young fellow doffed his hat and
bowed with a certain grace and deferential regard in
his manner, which led Storms, who was narrowly
watching him, to suspect that he was of high birth and
had moved in good circles before he had made his
d&eacute;but in this strange part of the world. Inez possessed
the same charming simplicity which had distinguished
her in her earlier years, though she was more reserved,
as was natural with her. She extended her hand to
Sanders, who gave it a gentle pressure, while he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;When I saw the signal fluttering up there I suspected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
there were persons here who wanted help, but
I never dreamed that we should find you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not me as well as any one else?&#8221; asked
Inez, with a smile. &#8220;Is there any reason why I
shouldn&#8217;t have misfortune the same as other persons?
If there is any such rule, I have never heard of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know of none; but shipwreck, as a general thing&ndash;&ndash;and
certainly in the case of your companions&ndash;&ndash;has
been a great injury to them. They look emaciated
and ill, and the captain is surely injured in the mind.
But you&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;well, never mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred laughed and broke down, for he really meant
to say nothing that could be construed into flattery or
impertinence. There was an air of goodness and refinement
about the girl which compelled the respect,
for the time at least, of the wild youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am so glad you have come,&#8221; said Inez, without
commenting upon his last words; &#8220;for though I have
been as cheerful as I could, it has been mainly on account
of the captain and Mr. Storms. I saw how
dejected they were, and tried to cheer them as best I
could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which was very kind in you. But, thank heaven!
it is all over now, and I hope we shall soon bear you
away from this place, that no doubt has become so
detestable in your eyes that you never want to see it
again.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I cannot say how dreadful it is and how much I
dislike it. The ship which ought to have taken us
away as it brought us, was broken to pieces on the
beach, and the mutineers, who thirsted for our lives,
were drowned when almost in reach, as may be said,
of the shore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here was some more unexpected information that
greatly interested Fred Sanders, who began to think
he would get at all the facts by interviewing each
member of the little company.</p>
<p>Mr. Storms heard the remark of Inez; but, while
he regretted it&ndash;&ndash;on the ground that it might raise
some more uncomfortable suspicions&ndash;&ndash;he did not care
particularly, for the sad story was one that could
easily be told, and upon which he was ready for cross-examination.
But what more interested him at that
moment was the fact that Captain Bergen just then
reached the cabin, and, instead of stopping within,
passed on beyond.</p>
<p>The conclusion of Storms was natural that he had
gone to the upper part of the island to dig up the
pearls; in which case, in his peculiar mental condition,
he would, most likely, lose them all. This would
never do, and the mate excused himself, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a little uneasy respecting the captain, and I
will leave you two here while I look after him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred Sanders saluted him, and told the truth when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
he said he would forgive his departure with pleasure;
with which the ragged mate went hurrying after the
ragged captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you step on board the proa for a little
while?&#8221; asked Fred, who was rather tired of standing
on the sand under the palm-trees. &#8220;As it is to be your
dwelling-place for a few days, you may like to select
your apartments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inez said she would be glad to do so, and Fred
uttered some sharp exclamation, which caused both of
the dusky natives to spring to their feet and hasten
to the side of the proa nearest the shore, where they
waited the chance to help her aboard. Inez noticed
that the islanders were muscular, athletic fellows,
with such a peculiar appearance that she could not
avoid staring at them for a few seconds. Each was
fully six feet in height&ndash;&ndash;an unusual stature among
the South Sea Islanders&ndash;&ndash;and their breasts, arms and
legs were tattooed with all sorts of figures and representations.
Since these portions of their anatomy
were uncovered, the singular ornamentation was very
prominent.</p>
<p>They had the curious tattooing on their cheeks,
noses and foreheads, so that their appearance was repellent.
Besides this, their teeth were black, their
noses large and flat, and their mouths wider than
there was any necessity for. Their heads were bare,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
and, indeed, were furnished by nature with all the
covering they could need. The hair was very long,
but frizzly, so that as it curled up about their ears
and crowns, it formed an immense bushy screen,
which gave their heads prodigious size. Their hands
and feet were very large, and it would have been hard,
in short, to discover anything in their looks that could
attract a person toward them. Surveying them dispassionately,
one could not help suspecting they belonged
to a tribe of cannibals.</p>
<p>However, Inez did not show any repulsion which
she might have felt, but stepping close to the proa took
the extended hand, and sprang lightly aboard of the
strange craft. The natives immediately withdrew,
leaving the young captain, as he appeared to be, to
conduct the fair visitor around the &#8220;ship,&#8221; whose
dimensions did not require much time to investigate.</p>
<p>Fred explained that the proa was a vessel peculiar
to the Indian and Central Pacific oceans, and that it
could sail with great swiftness, going either forward
or backward with equal readiness. It is a favorite
boat used for inter-communication between hundreds
of the islands of the South Seas, and the Malays
employ them in a different form for their piratical
expeditions. They owe their swiftness mainly to the
fact that they stand so high out of the water, are very
narrow, and present such a large surface to the wind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></div>
<p>&#8220;They are good for short voyages,&#8221; said Fred, &#8220;but
I shouldn&#8217;t want to start for New York or Liverpool
in one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long will it take us to reach the island from
which you came?&#8221; asked Inez.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we start early to-morrow morning, with a good
wind, we ought to be there at the end of two days.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was shorter time than he had given Mate
Storms, but he was now striving to speak the truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;And suppose we are overtaken by one of those
terrible tempests which sometimes visit this part of
the world?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We cannot escape the risk, no matter where we
are. The storm that would sink a proa might cause
a seventy-four to founder, and the only way you can
shun danger is to stay here all your life. I hardly
think that such is your wish, Miss Inez.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I am as anxious to leave as are Mr. Storms
and the captain. Indeed, I think I am more so, for
I understand that they expect to wait until to-morrow
morning, while if I had my wish I would start this
very hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are at the disposal of yourself and friends,&#8221;
Sanders courteously responded; &#8220;but the reason for
delay is that thereby we expect to be compelled to
spend but a single night on the voyage, while if we
started now we should have two.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>THE MATE BECOMES CAPTAIN</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Poor Jack!&#8221; murmured Abe Storms, hastening
after him. &#8220;I have been fearing this very thing. He
has taken the matter more to heart than I, and there
has been a look in his eye in the last few weeks which
showed he was not right; but I thought, when he
found he was going back to his home again, he would
almost instantly regain his mental equipoise.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it has operated the other way, and I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if he is as wild as a loon. When we get him
away, dress him up, change his food, and give him a
sight of a Boston vessel, he will be sure to come
around; but, he has said too much already.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what sort of a fellow that Fred Sanders
is?&#8221; added Storms, whose intellect seemed to be sharpened
by the same cause which overturned that of the
captain. &#8220;I would be glad to trust him fully, but
somehow, I can&#8217;t. While he is courteous and kind&ndash;&ndash;and,
no doubt, means to carry us all to the inhabited
island, where we shall be able to take care of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
ourselves&ndash;&ndash;there is something about him that awakens distrust.
The fact of his having been five years, as he says, in
these South Sea Islands, shows that all is not right,
which is confirmed by his dislike of saying anything
about his earlier history.</p>
<p>&#8220;The best thing in his favor is his youth, and yet,&#8221;
continued Storms, thoughtfully, &#8220;that, after all, may
be the worst. It would seem that he is too young to
have done a great deal of evil; and yet, if he has committed
many transgressions, it is a woful record for
such a lad. It was too bad that the captain hinted
that we have so much means, and he wouldn&#8217;t have
done it had he been in his right mind; but it has produced
an effect upon Sanders, as I could see by the
flash of his eyes, and the apparently indifferent questions
he asked afterwards.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have saved our ammunition,&#8221; muttered
Storms, a minute later, compressing his lips; &#8220;and I
know how to use my revolver, and it is only for a short
time that I shall have to maintain watch.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Abe Storms was talking to himself in this
fashion, he had his eye on the captain, who was walking
slowly toward that portion of the island where the
pearls had been concealed so carefully, and there could
be no doubt of his errand. He did not hear the soft
footstep behind him, which was so regulated that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
came up with him just as the latter paused at the all-important
spot.</p>
<p>The captain first looked out to sea, and then behind
him, catching sight, as he did so, of the smiling countenance
of his mate&ndash;&ndash;so far as his countenance could
be seen through the wealth of beard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! What are you doing here?&#8221; asked the captain,
in a voice which showed some perplexity, if not
displeasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; asked Storms, in turn,
slapping him familiarly on the shoulder. &#8220;I suppose
we came upon the same errand, as we are so soon to
leave for home. The pearls are buried here, and we
must carry them away with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that&#8217;s what I came for, Abe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m only saying I suspect it&#8217;s your business. I
know it&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen was a little bewildered by the sharp
manner in which the good-natured mate caught him
up, and, while he seemed to be debating with himself
what to say, Storms took his arm and led him a short
distance off, and, seating him on the beach, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no hurry about the business, Jack, for we
won&#8217;t start until to-morrow morning at daylight, so as
to have as few nights on the voyage as possible, and we
had better decide on the proper course for us to take.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is correct,&#8221; replied the captain, assenting so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
quietly that his friend hoped he would remain easily
manageable.</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember, Jack, that when we buried the
pearls there, we divided them&ndash;&ndash;your half is in a
strong canvas bag, so packed that they won&#8217;t rub together,
or make any noise; and mine are in another
sack. The single pearl which belongs to Inez is also
carefully covered; and now we must manage to get
away with them, without letting Sanders know they
are in our possession.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do that for?&#8221; demanded the
captain, turning fiercely upon the mate. &#8220;I like that
fellow. He&#8217;s going to put me on a ship and send me
back to Boston; and any one who does that does me
a service worth more than all the pearls in the world.
I am going to give him all mine, and I hope Inez will
do the same. I shall do my best to persuade her, and
if you don&#8217;t, Abe, you and I are deadly enemies, and
I&#8217;ll kill you the first chance!&#8221;</p>
<p>Storms showed his shrewdness by the manner in
which he managed the poor fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right, Jack,&#8221; he replied, assuming a
look and expression of anger, as he glared upon the
lunatic, well aware that he must make him afraid of
him. &#8220;If it&#8217;s any fun for you to talk in that style,
I&#8217;ll let you do it once, but don&#8217;t you try it again. Did
I ever tell you about those sixteen persons that I killed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
up in New Hampshire before we started out with the
<i>Coral?</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; gasped the captain, looking at him with awe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I won&#8217;t tell you now,&#8221; said the mate, with
the same frightful earnestness, &#8220;for it would make
you feel too bad. If they hadn&#8217;t made me mad, I
wouldn&#8217;t have killed them, and I&#8217;ll let up on you if
you do not say anything of the kind again. If you do,
I&#8217;ll get mad, Jack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the great horn spoon!&#8221; exclaimed the alarmed
captain, &#8220;I&#8217;ll let the matter drop, if you will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said the mate, relenting somewhat.
&#8220;And, mind you, don&#8217;t you go to talking to Sanders
about it. Don&#8217;t you tell him another thing, and never
mention the word pearls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;I won&#8217;t!&#8221; was the meek rejoinder of
poor Captain Bergen, who had been completely cowed
by the fierceness of his mate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m an awful man when my wrath is roused!&#8221;
Abe Storms thought it best to add; &#8220;and it was just
rising to the boiling-point when you were lucky
enough to take back your foolish expression.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we going to do now?&#8221; asked the captain,
apparently anxious to turn the current of conversation
into a more agreeable channel.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go back and make ready to leave on the proa.
We have considerable to do before we depart. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
are a number of things in the cabin that we must
carry with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s so; I forgot that. But, Abe&ndash;&ndash;don&#8217;t
you get mad!&ndash;&ndash;what about them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just never you mind,&#8221; replied the mate with an
important wave of the hand. &#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. I was afraid you would forget &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>It pained Storms to tyrannize over his superior officer
in this fashion, but stern necessity compelled
him to become the real captain. The intention of the
mate when he first followed his friend was to dig up
the pearls and give him his share, but he saw that that
would never do. It would precipitate a tragedy to
allow the lunatic any option in the matter. So, without
any further reference to the pearls, the two rose
to their feet and walked slowly back in the direction
of the proa, talking on no particular subject, since the
mate was desirous of diverting the mind of the captain
as much as possible.</p>
<p>The discoveries of the next few minutes did not
serve to lighten the apprehension of Storms, for when
he reached the proa the two islanders seemed to be
enjoying a siesta, while neither Fred Sanders nor
Inez was in sight.</p>
<p>Suspecting what was wanted, one of the natives
roused up and pointed toward the sea, jabbering some
odd words, which could not be understood, but which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Storms concluded were meant to indicate the direction
taken by the couple.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s almost the path to the spot where we were,&#8221;
he thought, as he turned and walked away, holding
the arm of the captain within his own.</p>
<p>Sure enough, they had not gone far when they
caught sight of Fred and Inez sitting on the beach,
just as if they were at some fashionable seaside resort
in summer time, and were chattering no particular
sense at all. Storms noticed that the place was such as
to command a view of that where he and the captain
had held their conversation, and where their precious
possessions were buried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder whether that was done on purpose?&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;It may be he meant nothing, but I fear
he took Inez along merely to hide the fact that he was
playing the spy upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not pleasant to believe this, and yet the suspicion
was rooted pretty firmly in the mind of the
mate, who, perhaps, was becoming over-suspicious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, how are you?&#8221; asked Sanders, with a laugh,
changing his lounging to the sitting position. &#8220;I conducted
Miss Inez over the proa, so as to make her acquainted
with the craft, as you may say, and since
that didn&#8217;t take long, we thought we would try a little
stroll down here, where we could have a talk without
those natives staring at us. How is your friend?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
asked the young man, suddenly lowering his voice to
such a sympathetic key that Storms felt guilty for
the moment for ever having suspected him capable of
wrong.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little uneasy about him,&#8221; was the reply, as
both glanced at the captain, who sat down beside Inez
and began talking to her, &#8220;for he seems to have broken
up all at once. He was such a strong man, just in the
prime of vigorous manhood, that it would hardly be
supposed he would give away so suddenly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he will soon recover, for the change will
be so radical, and the awakened hope so strong, that
he will be sure to rally in the course of a few days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; was the response, &#8220;but he must be
watched very carefully.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>FAREWELL TO THE ISLAND</h3>
</div>
<p>The weather remained enchanting. The tropical
heat was tempered by the ocean breeze, which stole
among the palms, and across the island, and where the
crew, and those who had lived there so long, lounged
in the shadow, or sauntered in the sunshine, when the
orb sank low in the western sky.</p>
<p>It was curious that now, after the coming of the
proa, when no other help was needed, the signal at the
masthead, as it may be called, seemed to have acquired
an unusual potency; for, on two separate occasions
during the afternoon, the island was approached by
vessels, who were given to understand that the parties
on shore were provided for. Mate Storms, now the
captain, very much doubted whether he did a wise
thing in declining this proffered assistance, but the
main reason for doing so was the fact that the pearls
were still buried, and he knew of no way of getting
them without discovery.</p>
<p>One of the ships was a Dutch one, from Java, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
the other was British, bound for Ceylon&ndash;&ndash;neither very
desirable, as they would have compelled a long, roundabout
voyage home. But Storms would have accepted
the offer of one on account of his distrust of the young
man, Fred Sanders, but for the reason given.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen, after the &#8220;setting back&#8221; given him
by Storms, became quiet and tractable, and stayed almost
entirely with Inez, for whom he showed the
greatest affection. Since she was tenderly attached
to him, and sympathized in his affliction, this kept the
two together almost continually&ndash;&ndash;an arrangement
which it was plain to see was not agreeable to Fred
Sanders, though he was too courteous to make any
mention of it.</p>
<p>During the afternoon such goods as were deemed
necessary were transferred to the proa, which lay at
anchor in the lagoon. These were not very numerous
or valuable, and consisted mostly of garments which
Storms had manufactured for Inez.</p>
<p>When night came, after a meal had been eaten on
shore close to where the proa lay, it was arranged
that Sanders should sleep on board with his crew&ndash;&ndash;if
two men might be termed such&ndash;&ndash;while the others
should stay in their cabin, as was their wont.</p>
<p>Storms contrived this on the plea that his companion,
the captain, would be more tractable. His real
purpose was to gain a chance to secure the pearls unnoticed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
The young man made not the slightest objection
to the plan, for he had too good sense to do so;
nor did his silence in that respect lull the suspicions
of Storms himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish there was not such a bright moon,&#8221; said the
mate to himself, not far from midnight, &#8220;for I need
all the quiet and darkness I can get; and I don&#8217;t see
any use of waiting longer,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen had been sleeping quietly for several
hours, while the silence in the apartment of Inez
showed that she, too, was wrapped in slumber, and
possibly dreaming of far-away scenes, of which her
memory was so misty and indistinct.</p>
<p>As to those upon the proa, everything must necessarily
be conjecture; but, in the middle of the night,
with his senses on the alert, and his imagination excited,
Abe Storms conjured up all sorts of fancies and
suspicions. There were many times when he believed
that these men, including the boyish leader, were the
worst kind of pirates, who were only waiting the
chance to secure the pearls, when they would either
desert or treacherously slay them. But, since meditation
and idleness could avail nothing, he rose from his
couch upon the floor, and, making sure that his loaded
revolver was in place, he stole out from among the
palm trees, and began moving in the direction of the
spot where his treasures lay hid.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></div>
<p>He did this with the utmost precaution, glancing in
every direction at each step, frequently pausing and
changing the course he was pursuing, and, in short,
doing everything he could think of to prevent detection.
The full moon rode high in an almost unclouded
sky, and the air was as charming as that of Italy.
The solemn roar of the ocean and the irregular boom
of the long, immense swells breaking against the shore
and sending the thin sheets of foam sliding swiftly up
the bank, were the only sounds that greeted his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed the searcher, for
all at once he descried a ship, under full sail, seemingly
within two hundred yards of shore. &#8220;If these
parties hadn&#8217;t arrived to-day this craft wouldn&#8217;t have
come within a score of miles of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The ship looked like a vast bird, when with all
sail set and her black hull careening to one side under
the wind, she drove the foaming water away from her
bows, and sped forward as if pursuing or fleeing from
some enemy.</p>
<p>Whether the watch saw the signal of distress in the
moonlight, cannot be known, but the vessel speedily
passed on, and vanished in the night, while Mate
Storms, recalling his thoughts, and seeing no one near
him, moved directly to where he had deposited his
riches such a long time before, and to which he only
made an occasional visit.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></div>
<p>He had advanced too far to retreat, whether he was
seen or not, and he stooped down and began digging
with his hands and sheath-knife. It was only a short
distance, when he struck something, and a moment
after drew up a small, strong canvas bag. Soon came
another, and then a smaller one, which contained the
wonderful pearl that belonged to Inez Hawthorne.
They were all there, and had not been disturbed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, it only remains to keep these in my possession,&#8221;
was his thought, as he straightened up and
started to return. &#8220;I would give half of them if they
were at home and safe in the bank&ndash;&ndash;Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the vision of the sailor was unusually keen
just then, for when he paused with a start he caught
sight of a shadowy figure, which seemed to glide,
without any effort of its own, over the sand, and
immediately disappeared among the palm trees.
There was something so peculiar in its movements
that Abe was chilled with awe as he stood still and
watched it for the few seconds it remained in view.
But there could be no doubt of its identity. It was
Fred Sanders, who had been on the watch, and who
must have seen the mate dig up the treasures, and
knew they were now in his possession.</p>
<p>Storms was in anything but a comfortable frame of
mind while walking thoughtfully back to the cabin,
which he entered.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></div>
<p>&#8220;What more likely than that he will steal up here
in the night, believing I am asleep, and try to shoot
me? Well, if he does so, he shall find me prepared for
him, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first proceeding of the mate was to deposit the
pearls contained in the three diminutive canvas sacks
in a small valise, which he had carefully preserved all
through the years, and which now held a few necessities
that he meant to take away with him. The addition
of these precious contents taxed the receptacle
to its fullest capacity, but, after all, this was the best
thing to do, and he believed he would be able to keep
it under his eye during the comparatively short time
they would be on the voyage to Wauparmur Island.</p>
<p>It may be said, indeed, that there was nothing else
to be done, which rendered it unfortunate that he
could not secure a few hours&#8217; sleep before venturing
away in the proa. But the nerves of the mate were
too unstrung by his position to feel easy, and he placed
himself by the opening of the cabin, with his hand
upon the weapon, prepared to watch until daylight.</p>
<p>As might have been supposed, in spite of his uneasiness,
he gradually became drowsy, and it was not
long before his head sank on his breast, and he, too,
was asleep. It was well he did so, for he gained the
rest so necessary, and as it was, he might have slept
longer had he not been awakened by outside causes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></div>
<p>Captain Bergen slept on, but Inez was on her feet
at an early hour, and seeing that Storms was unconscious,
she passed out without disturbing him, and
made her way to the spring, where she always performed
her morning ablutions.</p>
<p>It was natural that the mate, going to sleep as he
did, with his mind filled with the most dismal of
fancies, should find his slumbers visited by horrible
phantasies. He was struggling with the figure of a
man, who had the face of Fred Sanders, and they
were bearing each other over an immense cliff, when
his opponent got the upper hand, and, holding him
suspended for the moment, began to laugh at his
calamity. The laugh grew louder, until it awoke the
startled sleeper, who, opening wide his eyes, saw the
veritable figure of Fred Sanders before him, laughing
as heartily as he had been doing in the struggle in
sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy! where&#8217;s the valise?&#8221; gasped the bewildered
Storms, clutching at the receptacle which lay at
his side. &#8220;I thought you had stolen it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then the quick-witted sailor recalled his situation,
and he, too, broke into mirth, in which there was
not much heartiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a curious dream I had, Sanders! I really
believe I have been asleep!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what is strange about that, since a full night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
has passed since we last met? I hope you have had
a good rest, even though your awaking was not so
pleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>Abe Storms was excessively chagrined, for his
very action, when aroused so unexpectedly, would, of
itself, have turned suspicion to the satchel, which he
snatched up like a startled miser. This action, united
with what Captain Bergen had said, and with what
the young man himself had witnessed the preceding
night, could not have failed to tell him that that rusty-looking
valise&ndash;&ndash;about which the owner was so careful&ndash;&ndash;contained
a great amount of wealth in some form.</p>
<p>But what of it?</p>
<p>This was the question Storms put to himself as he
sprang up and called to Inez&ndash;&ndash;who immediately appeared&ndash;&ndash;and
began the preparation for the last meal
they expected to eat upon the detested island.</p>
<p>Captain Bergen was quiet and thoughtful, but the
others were in high spirits.</p>
<p>The two natives made their meal on board the proa,
where they stolidly awaited the coming of the passengers,
the &#8220;baggage&#8221; having been transferred the day
before. And the sun was no more than fairly above
the horizon when the proa started on her eventful
voyage to Wauparmur Island&ndash;&ndash;a voyage destined to
be marked by events of which no one on board
dreamed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>ON THE FLYING PROA</h3>
</div>
<p>At last the friends who had been left on Pearl
Island three years before, and whose hearts had been
bowed with despair more than once, saw the atoll
gradually fade from view, until the top of the tallest
palm-tree dipped out of sight in the blue Pacific and
vanished from view forever.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems hardly possible,&#8221; said Abe Storms, when
at last his straining vision could detect no shadow of
the spot, &#8220;that we have been rescued. I&#8217;m so full of
joy and hope at the prospect before me that it is hard
work to restrain myself from shouting and jumping
overboard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your idea in jumping overboard?&#8221; asked
Sanders, with a laugh, in which Inez Hawthorne
joined.</p>
<p>&#8220;Merely to give expression to my exuberance of
joy; after I should cool off, I would be cooler, of
course.&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Bergen, to the grief of his friends, showed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
no signs of mental improvement, though his hallucination
took a different form. Instead of being talkative,
like he was the day before, he became reserved, saying
nothing to any one, not even to answer a simple question
when it was put to him. He ensconced himself at
the stern in such a position that he was out of the
way of the man with the steering oar, where he curled
up like one who wished neither to be seen nor heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Humor his fancies,&#8221; said Sanders, &#8220;for it will
only aggravate him to notice them. It was the same
with Redvignez and Brazzier that I was speaking
about last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Redvignez and Brazzier?&#8221; repeated Inez; &#8220;where
did you ever see them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sailed a voyage with them once from Liverpool,
and I was telling Mr. Storms last night that I saw
them both so frightened without cause that their
minds were upset for a while. And may I ask whether
you know them?&#8221; asked the young man, with a flush
of surprise, addressing the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, they and a negro, Pomp, were the three mutineers
who were the means of our staying on the
island. They tried to kill the captain and mate,
but&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She saved us,&#8221; broke in Storms, who thereupon
gave the narrative told long ago to the reader, omitting
the attempt that was made upon his own life by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
cutting the hose-pipes which let the air down to him,
inasmuch as that would have caused the telling of the
pearl fishing also.</p>
<p>Fred Sanders listened with great interest, for he
had known the men well, and it may as well be stated
that the danger to which the scoundrels were exposed,
as referred to by him, was that of being executed for
mutiny; and, as it was, the part of Sanders himself
was such that he would have been strung up at the
yard-arm in short order had it not been his extreme
youth, which pleaded in his favor.</p>
<p>Since Storms and his companions had revealed
some things that might have been better concealed, so
Fred Sanders himself felt he had hinted at a little
story which was likely to injure his standing in the
eyes of those toward whom he was playing the part of
the good Samaritan.</p>
<p>The proa was arranged as comfortably as possible,
Inez Hawthorne being given a place in front, where a
sort of compartment was made for her, by means of
stretching awnings of cocoa-matting and a portion of
the reserve fund of lateen on hand. The others disposed
themselves so that she was left undisturbed
whenever she chose to withdraw to her &#8220;state room,&#8221;
as Captain Fred Sanders facetiously termed it.</p>
<p>The two natives had little to say, and they obeyed
orders like the veritable slaves they were. There could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
be no doubt they understood the management of the
proa to perfection, and the strange craft spun through
the water with astonishing speed.</p>
<p>Mr. Storms deposited his valise, with its valuable
contents, forward, where he seemed to bestow little
attention on it, though, as may well be supposed, it
was ever present in his thoughts, and quite often in
his eye.</p>
<p>Several times in the course of the day they caught
sight of sails in the distance, but approached none;
for, as Sanders said, the all-important thing now was
to make the most speed possible, while the opportunity
remained to them. There was a freshening of the
breeze and a haziness which spread through the northern
horizon that caused some misgiving on the part
of all, for the proa would be a poor shelter in case
they were overtaken by one of those terrific tempests
they had seen more than once.</p>
<p>Toward the middle of the afternoon something like
a low bank of clouds appeared to the left, or in the
west, which, being scrutinized through the glasses,
proved to be a low-lying island. Sanders knew of it,
and said they passed it still closer on their way to the
atoll.</p>
<p>It was also an atoll like that, but much smaller in
size, and, of course, uninhabited. It might do for a
refuge in case of the coming of a violent storm, while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
in the vicinity; but otherwise it would only be a loss
of time to pause at it. The fact that such a place existed
so near them caused something like a feeling of
security upon the part of Mate Storms, such as comes
over one on learning he has a good friend at his elbow
in face of some coming trouble.</p>
<p>As the afternoon advanced, and the proa bounded
forward before a strong, steady breeze, Storms thought
the occasion a good one to obtain some sleep, with a
view of keeping awake during the coming night, and
he assumed an easy position, where, his mind being
comparatively free from apprehension, he soon sank
into slumber.</p>
<p>This left Inez Hawthorne with no one to talk to
excepting Fred Sanders, who seemed in better spirits
than usual. When they had discussed the voyage, and
he had given her as good an account as he could of the
island toward which they were hastening, and after
she had answered all his questions as best she could,
she turned upon him and asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;How long did you say you had spent in these
islands?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As nearly as I can recollect, it is about five years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, as you are now seventeen, you must have
been only twelve years old when you first came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That agrees with my figuring,&#8221; said Sanders, with
a nod of his head. &#8220;You can&#8217;t be far out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Where did you live before that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I lived in a good many places&ndash;&ndash;that is, for
two years. I was on the Atlantic and on the Pacific
and&ndash;&ndash;well, it would take me a good long while to tell
of all that I passed through. I may as well own up
to you, Inez, that it was a wild, rough life for a man,
even without taking into account the fact that I was a
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you went to sea when you were only ten
years old?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That also coincides with my mathematical calculations,&#8221;
replied Sanders, somewhat embarrassed, for
he saw they were approaching delicate ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then before you were ten years of age?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I lived at home, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And where was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will excuse me, Inez, from answering that
question. I have reasons for doing so. Let me say
that I stayed at home for the first ten years of my
existence, and was as bad a boy as can be imagined.
I fell into the worst kind of habits, and it was through
the two men&ndash;&ndash;Redvignez and Brazzier&ndash;&ndash;whom I&#8217;ve
heard you speak of, that I was persuaded to go to sea
with them, when I ought to have been at home with
my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your mother living, Mr. Sanders?&#8221;</p>
<p>The youth turned his head away, so she could not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
see his face, and when he moved it back and spoke
again there was a tear on his cheek, and he replied,
in a voice of sadness:</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother is in heaven, where her son will never
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inez was inexpressibly shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Mr. Sanders, what do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A better woman than she never lived, nor a worse
boy than I. You can&#8217;t understand, Inez. You are
too young and too good yourself to realize what a
wretch I was. I deliberately ran away from home
seven years ago, and have never been within a thousand
miles of it since, and I never expected to do so,
until within the last day or so; somehow or other, I&#8217;ve
fallen to thinking more than before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you a father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I think he is dead, too, for I was
enough to break his heart, and I have never heard of
him since. I hadn&#8217;t any brothers or sisters when I
came away. I&#8217;m all that&#8217;s left, and now there is a
longing coming over me to hunt up my father again
before he dies, that is&ndash;&ndash;if&ndash;&ndash;he&ndash;&ndash;isn&#8217;t&ndash;&ndash;already&ndash;&ndash;gone!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was no use. Fred Sanders, the wild, reckless
youth, who had passed through many a scene that
would have made a man shudder, suddenly put his
hands to his face, and his whole frame shook with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
emotion. The memories of his early childhood came
back to him, and he saw again the forms of those who
loved him so fondly, and whose affection he returned
with such piercing ingratitude. Conscience had slept
for many years, but the gentle words of Inez had
awakened its voice again. The goodness of the girl,
who was already like a loved sister to Sanders, had
stirred up the better part of his nature, and he looked
upon himself with a shudder, that one so young as he
should have committed his many transgressions.</p>
<p>No wonder that he felt so pressed down that he
cried out in the bitterness of his spirit that heaven
was shut from him. It was hard for Inez to keep
back the sympathizing tears herself when she witnessed
the overwhelming grief of the strong youth.</p>
<p>The latter sat silent for some minutes, holding his
face partly averted, as if ashamed of this evidence of
weakness&ndash;&ndash;an evidence which it is safe to say he had
not shown for years, young as he was.</p>
<p>Ah, there were memories that had slumbered long
which came crowding upon the boy&ndash;&ndash;memories whose
import no one on board that strange craft could suspect
but himself, and whose work was soon to appear
in a form and with a force that neither Inez Hawthorne
nor Mate Storms so much as dreamed of.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE CRAFT</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I tell you a boy who uses his mother bad is sure
to suffer for it some time. I&#8217;ve seen so many cases
that I know there&#8217;s such a law that governs the whole
world. I thank heaven that I never brought a tear
to my mother&#8217;s eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker was Captain Bergen, who was talking
to Fred Sanders while the two sat together on the
proa, near midnight succeeding the conversation mentioned
between Inez and the youth Fred.</p>
<p>The latter might have believed, as he had jocosely
remarked, that he had captured a small party of missionaries,
who were making a dead set at him; but his
feelings had been touched in a most tender manner,
and he had done more thinking during the last few
hours than in all his previous life.</p>
<p>The only one on the proa who was on duty was
Fred, who held the steering-oar in place, while the
curiously-shaped vessel sped through the water. The
sea was very calm and the wind so slight that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
were in reality going slower than at any previous
time, and the task of guiding the boat was hardly a
task at all.</p>
<p>Fred sat looking up at the stars half the time, with
his memory and conscience doing their work. His two
men had lain down, and were asleep, for they were
regular in all their habits, and he had seen nothing of
Inez since she had withdrawn to her &#8220;apartment.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mate Storms kept up a fragmentary conversation
with the young captain until quite late, when he
withdrew, and Fred was left with himself for fully
two hours, when Mr. Bergen crept softly forth and
took a seat near him, even getting in such a position
that he would have been very much in the way had
any emergency arisen. The captain was disposed to
talk&ndash;&ndash;somewhat to Fred&#8217;s dislike&ndash;&ndash;for he was in that
mood when he desired to be alone; but he was also in
a more gracious and charitable temper than usual, and
he answered the old captain quite kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a good deal to be thankful for,&#8221; said he, in
reply to the remark above given. &#8220;But my mother has
been in heaven for many a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is fortunate, after all,&#8221; said the captain, with
a sigh, and a far-away look over the moonlit sea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a great deal more fortunate than her son will
ever be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It all depends on you, young man,&#8221; said the captain,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
severely. &#8220;Heaven is reached step by step, and
there&#8217;s no one who cannot make it. If you haven&#8217;t
started in the right direction, now&#8217;s the time to do so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred Sanders may have assented to this, but he was
silent, and he, too, looked off over the sea as if his
thoughts were running in a new and unaccustomed
channel. &#8220;My mother must be a very old woman by
this time,&#8221; added the captain, after a minute or more
of silence, during which nothing but the rushing of
the water was heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;How old is she?&#8221; asked Fred.</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be close on to eighty; and I think she&#8217;s
dead, for she was very feeble when I saw her, three
years ago, in San Francisco. But I&#8217;m going to see
her very soon; yes, very soon&ndash;&ndash;very soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long way to &#8217;Frisco,&#8221; ventured Fred, mildly;
&#8220;but I hope you will have a quick voyage.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not going to wait till we get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you going to manage it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This way. I&#8217;m coming, mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Captain Jack Bergen sprang overboard and
went out of sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens! what was that?&#8221; exclaimed Mate
Storms, leaping forward from where he had been
dozing upon his couch.</p>
<p>&#8220;The captain has jumped overboard!&#8221; was the horrified
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
reply of Fred Sanders, who was bringing the
proa around as fast as he could.</p>
<p>Without another word, Mate Storms made a bounding
plunge after him, leaving the young captain to
manage the craft as best he could. The latter uttered
a sharp command which brought the crew to their feet
in an instant, and, in an incredibly short space of
time, the proa came around, and, scarcely losing any
headway, moved back toward the spot where the demented
man had sprung into the sea, which was now
a long distance astern.</p>
<p>It was a startling awaking for Abram Storms, who
did his utmost for his unfortunate captain. The mate
was a splendid swimmer, and, plunging forward with
a powerful stroke, he called to his friend again and
again, frequently lifting himself far out of the water,
when on the crest of a swell, and straining his eyes
to pierce the moonlight about him, hoping to catch
sight of the figure of the captain, who was also a
strong swimmer. But if he had jumped overboard
with the intention of suicide, it was not to be supposed
he would continue swimming. The mate, however,
was hopeful that in that awful minute when he went
beneath the waters, something like a realizing sense
of what he had done would come to him and he would
struggle to save himself.</p>
<p>But, alas, for poor Captain Jack Bergen, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
journeyed so many thousand miles, and had endured
such a long imprisonment upon a lonely island! He
sent back no answering shout to the repeated calls of
his mate, whose eyes failed to catch sight of his gray
head as he rose and sank for a brief while on the
water.</p>
<p>When Fred Sanders got the proa about he guided
its movements by the sound of the mate&#8217;s voice, and,
in a short while, he ran alongside and assisted him
on board. Nothing had been seen nor heard of the
captain, and there could be no doubt now that he was
gone forever. Nevertheless, the proa continued cruising
around the place for fully an hour, in widening
circles, until all were convinced that not a particle of
hope remained, when they filled away again, and a
long, last farewell was uttered to Captain Jack
Bergen.</p>
<p>He had procured a fortune in a comparatively
easy manner, and it looked for a time as if the payment
was small; but the price demanded now was his
life, and what more can a man give, excepting his
soul?&ndash;&ndash;which, most happily, was not the case with
him.</p>
<p>During these minutes of excitement, Inez Hawthorne
slept soundly, and she never knew anything of
the sad occurrence until the morrow was well advanced.
Her grief prostrated her for many hours, for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
she was a child unusually affectionate by nature, and
she had been tenderly attached to the captain, who
had been such a father to her.</p>
<p>It spread a gloom over the boat, as may be said,
the only ones who showed no sorrow in their countenances
being the dusky islanders, who seemed to take
everything as it came along as a matter of course, and
who obeyed the Caucasian captain like so many machines
under the control of an engineer.</p>
<p>Fred Sanders was thoughtful, and, what was rather
curious, had little to say to Inez during the first portion
of the day. He uttered a few words of sympathy
when she sought to restrain her tears, but after that he
kept very much to himself, as if there was some new
and important matter on his mind, as was indeed the
case.</p>
<p>It will be remembered that the expectation was that
the voyage of the proa would terminate that night by
their arrival at their destination, but the delay caused
by the moderate wind and the search for the lost captain
led Mate Storms to feel some doubt, and he asked
Captain Sanders his view of the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you anything about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not these words alone, so much as the abrupt
manner, which set the mate somewhat back. He had
received nothing of the kind from the youth since
their meeting, and it astonished him.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>A hot reply rose to the lips of Abe Storms, but he
suppressed it and moved away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder whether he doesn&#8217;t feel soured at the
thought that the death of the captain will prevent his
getting such a large reward for his services?&#8221; said the
mate to himself, who, after thinking over the matter
for a few minutes longer, reached a conclusion. &#8220;We
expected to reach Wauparmur Island to-night, before
dark. We shall be late, but, as it is, I shall have no
trouble in keeping awake the rest of the voyage, and
I&#8217;ve little fear that I will not be able to protect my
property as well as myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this, he moved back to the youth, and said, in
a cheery voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;You recall, sir, that poor Captain Bergen made
some promises to you about rewarding you liberally
for your services. My friend was a little wild in what
he said, but he was right when he declared we had the
means, and I wish simply to say that his wishes and
intentions in that respect, which accorded with my
own from the start, shall be carried out to the letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Storms immediately joined Inez, while the captain
made no reply, much to the discomfiture of the
mate, who said to Inez:</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with Sanders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is watching an object over the sea yonder. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
has been expecting to discover something, and he has
caught sight of it at last.&#8221;</p>
<p>The mate instantly produced his glasses, and leveled
them in the direction the young captain was
looking.</p>
<p>There was something, indeed.</p>
<p>As revealed by the instrument, it was what might
be termed a double canoe, or proa&ndash;&ndash;that is, two narrow
canoes were joined together, side by side, and connected
by a sort of framework, while an enormous
lateen sail towered above them, and carried it forward
with remarkable speed.</p>
<p>The surprised mate carefully scrutinized the
strange craft, and saw that it contained a large crew,
there being, as he estimated, fully twenty men on
board. It was to the westward of the smaller proa,
and like that was pursuing almost a northerly course,
though the experienced eyes of the sailor told him
that the paths of the two were converging, and that,
unless changed, they undoubtedly would meet before
nightfall.</p>
<p>The double canoe was about two miles distant, and
as it rose on the crest of a swell the glass revealed the
white foam which curled away from the bows, and
there could be no doubt of its remarkable swiftness.</p>
<p>After watching this strange craft for a few minutes,
Mr. Storms devoted some time to a furtive but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
careful study of the face of Fred Sanders, who was on
the most elevated portion of the proa, and was carefully
noting the course of the two vessels.</p>
<p>The alarming conclusion reached by Abram Storms
was that the other craft contained a gang of pirates;
that Fred Sanders knew them, and he was guiding his
own proa by an understanding previously had with
them.</p>
<p>And Abram Storms was right.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>A FRIEND AMONG ENEMIES</h3>
</div>
<p>The double canoe, with its cumbersome lateen sail
and its crew of twenty-odd pirates, had stolen down
from somewhere among the Paumotu Islands, and
was now gradually approaching the proa which contained
Abram Storms and Inez Hawthorne.</p>
<p>The experience of the preceding few years, and
especially of the last day or two, had given Mr. Storms
an astonishing acuteness, which enabled him often to
detect the truth without difficulty. The strong suspicion
he now formed was that Fred Sanders was expecting
the appearance of the craft, and that he was
guiding his own proa in accordance with some prearranged
plan. This was an alarming conclusion to
reach, but Storms felt hardly a particle of doubt that
he was right.</p>
<p>&#8220;He intends to betray us, and has intended to do so
from the first.&#8221;</p>
<p>The New Englander took another look at the double
canoe, and he saw, even in the few minutes that had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
passed, that they were closer together. And now that
his suspicions were aroused, he detected several other
little things which only confirmed all that had entered
his mind. The two islanders who composed the crew
were continually glancing off at their brothers, and
frequently spoke in low tones, and showed by the
gleam of their swarthy faces that they were on the
tip-toe of expectation.</p>
<p>From one corner of the lateen sail, Storms now noticed
that a large crimson handkerchief was fluttering
in the wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is put there as a signal,&#8221; was the decision respecting
that, &#8220;and doubtless signifies that they have
us on board and all is going right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred Sanders was so occupied with this business
that he never once suspected that he himself was being
watched in turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Inez,&#8221; said the mate, &#8220;go to the captain and speak
a few words to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is so occupied that he will not wish to be
disturbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about that; I wish you to go and say
a few pleasant words to him. Let them be sympathetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can give you no further directions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am loth to do so, but if you wish it&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I wish it very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was enough, and the girl, with some natural
hesitation of manner, advanced to the young captain,
who did not notice her until she was at his elbow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-day, Captain Fred,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you have
been busy so long that you must be tired, for you
slept none last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked toward her with a quick, curious expression.
There was a half-smile on his face, while his
forehead was wrinkled with displeasure. Inez noticed
this, and would have withdrawn had she not
recalled the strange earnestness with which Storms
made the request for her to utter a few pleasant words
to the youth. She therefore determined to carry out
his wishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we relieve you of your work?&#8221; continued
she.</p>
<p>Sanders was in reality doing nothing in the way of
physical labor, since the steering oar was in the hands
of one of the crew, but he was absorbed in &#8220;watching
things,&#8221; as the expression goes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure there is no way in which you can relieve
me,&#8221; said Fred, unbending somewhat from his
reserve.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are in such deep water, and the wind is so fair,
that there can be no danger, I suppose. But tell me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
what sort of a boat is that yonder which is pursuing
nearly the same course with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&ndash;&ndash;I presume,&#8221; was the hesitating response,
as the young man glanced in that direction, &#8220;is one of
the double canoes or proas which are often seen among
these islands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And who are the crew?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Islanders, like my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to meet them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly know what to answer to that,&#8221; said Fred,
looking inquiringly toward the large proa again, as if
he had not seen it before.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Captain Sanders, they must be pirates,&#8221; said
Inez, stepping close to him, and speaking in a low,
tremulous voice; &#8220;but whether they are or not, my
faith in God and in you cannot be changed. I know
you will do all you can for us&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There! there!&#8221; protested the young captain, with
an expression of pain on his face, &#8220;say no more.
Please go away, Inez, and leave me alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will leave you, if you do not wish me
here, but gratitude would not let me keep silent. I
know, from what you said last night, that you have a
good heart, and henceforth conscience is to be your
master and guide.&#8221;</p>
<p>And without looking to see the effect of her words,
Inez left the captain to his own thoughts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>Abram Storms, with folded arms, was intently
watching him, and he carefully studied his countenance.
He was still doing so, when Inez turned her
back upon Sanders. Mr. Storms noted the strange expression
on the handsome countenance, and just then
Sanders turned and looked straight at the man before
the latter could withdraw his gaze. As their eyes met,
he signaled to Storms to approach, and the latter, with
no little wonderment and some misgiving, did so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Storms,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that double canoe off yonder
has twenty-three pirates on board.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspected as much,&#8221; coolly replied the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a set of worse villains cannot be found in the
South Seas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure you are quite right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These two men that I have on board belong to the
same crew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed! I hadn&#8217;t thought of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I belong to the same gang.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suspected that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, eh? Did you suspect that I was in the
plot to obtain possession of your pearls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not suspect it; I was sure of it, which is why
I have carried my loaded revolver with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t have defeated the plan we had laid,
for when twenty-three odd savages, with their spears,
war-clubs and a few muskets, had stolen up to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
island in the darkness, and crept silently into your
cabin, what good would your guns and revolvers have
done you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Was that the plan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was it precisely. By some means or other,
which I never could understand, rumors reached Wauparmur,
months ago, that two men and a child were
on an island to the south of us, and that they had an
immense lot of the most valuable pearls. I cannot
comprehend how it was the natives gained such
knowledge, for it must have had some basis of truth,
inasmuch as it proved to be true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a proa which passed close to the island
while we were opening the pearl-oysters,&#8221; said Storms.
&#8220;We all saw it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The rumor came from them, then,&#8221; continued
Sanders, &#8220;and a party was formed to go down there,
and find out whether it was true, and, in case it was,
the white men were to be overcome by treachery, and
their possessions in the shape of pearls taken. Since
there is no more desperate and wicked member of the
gang than am I, of course I was one of the first
chosen.</p>
<p>&#8220;We started in two boats, and, as we went along, I
could see difficulties in the way which never occurred
to them. It was not likely you carried the pearls
about with you, as a person wears his jewelry; but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
most likely they were buried, so that if we came
down upon you and made an overwhelming attack, as
was first intended, we might put you all to death, and
then be unable to find where you had hidden your
treasures. Besides that, I saw that it was more than
probable you had firearms, with which you could successfully
hold out against a large force, and it would
prove no easy thing to subdue you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were correct in both your surmises,&#8221; said
Storms. &#8220;We were always prepared to make a fight,
and, with our guns against your spears, we would
have beaten you off. The pearls, too, were carefully
concealed where you never would have found them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was well convinced of that, so we resorted to
strategy. I was to go with a couple of the men and
bring you away, trying all the time if I could to secure
the pearls, which, of course, were afterwards to
be disposed of and the proceeds divided among us&ndash;&ndash;the
intention being that when we got you on the proa,
you would be pitched overboard, for then the situation
would be so changed that we could manage it without
trouble. If I thought it unsafe to make the attempt,
I had only to wait until reinforcements should come
up; for the larger boat, knowing the course I was to
take on my return, had only to be on the lookout for
us, and we would be sure to descry each other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that was to be your signal that you had us
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
aboard?&#8221; said Storms, pointing to the fluttering handkerchief.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it precisely,&#8221; assented Sanders. &#8220;But there
was one force which we did not think to provide
against,&#8221; added the young man, in a low voice, in
which Storms detected a slight tremor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An awakened conscience,&#8221; was the impressive answer.
&#8220;And it was she who aroused the sleeper.
There was something in the goodness of the girl&ndash;&ndash;the
faith which she showed not only in heaven but in
me as well&ndash;&ndash;that upset all my calculations. Then,
too, she seemed to say the right words just at the right
time; and you saw how I suffered.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and it gave me great hope; for, Fred, I distrusted
you from the beginning. I saw many little
things which you never supposed I nor any one else
would notice. And I may add,&#8221; said the mate, with
a sly twinkle, &#8220;that I endeavored always to be prepared
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The face of Sanders flushed, but he added, with the
same seriousness:</p>
<p>&#8220;Matters now are going in accordance with the program
arranged days ago. The large proa yonder has
been waiting for us, and we are now to keep on converging
lines until we meet to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you intend to follow out your agreement?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No; I had an awful struggle with my conscience
last night, after my talk with Inez and with the poor
captain, but the evil triumphed in me, despite all I
could do. The fight was still going on, being renewed
this morning, and I had about yielded to Satan, when
she came and spoke to me. That,&#8221; said Fred Sanders,
with a compression of the lips, &#8220;has settled it forever.
I am now your friend, and I am ready to give up my
life for the safety of you and her, hoping that heaven
will take it, with my repentance, as some atonement
for the many sins I have committed.&#8221;</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XXXIII_THE_PURSUIT' id='CHAPTER_XXXIII_THE_PURSUIT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>THE PURSUIT</h3>
</div>
<p>There are two angels within us forever struggling
for the mastery: One is the angel of darkness, and
the other of light&ndash;&ndash;of evil and of good.</p>
<p>They had waged their battle in the heart of Fred
Sanders for a long time, and too often did the restraining
spirit fold her hands over her face and
withdraw in sorrow at the triumph of the other. But
the final struggle&ndash;&ndash;the decisive warfare&ndash;&ndash;was now
ended, and the beauteous countenance of the good
angel was radiant with hope and courage, for a soul
had been saved.</p>
<p>Abram Storms smiled with pleasure as he looked
upon the manly young fellow, and he was filled with
delight at the resolution shown by him.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no shrinking or trembling there,&#8221; said
Storms to himself. &#8220;He means every word he says,
and he will stick to the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man tried to look calm and self-possessed, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
he moved forward and extended his hand, but there
were tears in his eyes, and he could only murmur:</p>
<p>&#8220;God bless you, my boy! You have chosen the
better part.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were silent for a minute or so, each one&#8217;s
thoughts active, when Fred said:</p>
<p>&#8220;If you please, I would rather that Inez should
know nothing of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She never shall know a word of it from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One of these days, perhaps, I will tell her what a
villain she was the means of saving from destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred appreciated the skill, seamanship and shrewdness
of Storms, and consulted fully with him, saying
that, as he himself was captain, he would appoint the
other to his old position&ndash;&ndash;that of mate.</p>
<p>The whole scheme had already been made clear by
the youth. The large proa was in sight, by appointment,
having been cruising back and forth for several
days, on the lookout for the smaller boat with the
party who it was expected would be robbed and killed
for the valuable pearls in their possession. The signal
of the fluttering handkerchief from the triangular sail
meant that the party were on board, and the original
program was to be carried out. That is, the pursuing
boat was to hold off until after dark. She was to keep
on a converging course, so as not to lose sight of the
small proa, and gradually approaching, overhaul and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
attack her at the time when the chances of success
were at the best.</p>
<p>The plan decided upon by Captain Sanders was
simply to keep away from the larger craft, and to do
his utmost to prevent being overhauled; and he
showed his earnestness in this respect by taking the
steering oar and bearing away from the other, so that,
instead of being converging, they became parallel.</p>
<p>The two natives displayed some surprise when they
observed this action, but they said nothing, and most
likely felt no suspicion as yet of their captain, whose
desperation and heartlessness on more than one previous
occasion had won the confidence of the islanders.</p>
<p>It was not long before the change was noticed on
board the pursuer, where, most likely, it was accepted
as the proper thing, possibly on account of the fear
from the passengers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have no revolver like you,&#8221; said Captain Fred,
after they had kept this up for a couple of hours, &#8220;but
I have a double-barreled pistol which is loaded to the
muzzle. You have your six-chambered weapon, and
you must keep it ready, for, when the two islanders
here become certain of the truth, it is more than probable
they will make a savage attack on us, for two
more desperate demons never lived.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hardly think so,&#8221; said the mate, glancing
furtively at them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No; they are as meek looking as lambs, but they
were sent with me on account of their fierce courage.
Why, they were ready and eager, when we visited you
upon the island, to make an open attack, where the
chances of their defeat were about even. They would
rather fight and kill any moment than eat, and I had
to be pretty sharp to restrain them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t forget your warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do for either of us to sleep to-night, for
they are as treacherous as cobras. They would feign
slumber on purpose to put us off our guard, and then
stab us to death in our sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will we not reach Wauparmur to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is doubtful, for the change we have made in
the course is taking us away from the true direction
and gives the advantage to them, as they are closer in
than we. We have lost some good ground from the
lightness of the wind, and we shall be fortunate if we
catch sight of the place before to-morrow&#8217;s sunrise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, Captain Fred, it must be a question of
speed between us and our pursuer. Which, therefore,
is the faster, the double canoe yonder or ourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>A troubled expression came over the face of the
young captain, as he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, for there has never been a test. We
kept company most of the way out, but we rattled
along without any thought of speed, sometimes together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
and sometimes apart; but my opinion is that in
moderate weather like the present there is little difference
between us, or if there is any it is in our favor.
In a strong wind, the other would he apt to outspeed
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going to have more wind,&#8221; said the mate,
looking anxiously about him. &#8220;I think I perceive it
freshening already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I fear the same thing,&#8221; said Fred, who was manifestly
very uneasy. &#8220;We are now about two miles
apart, and the prospect is that that will be cut down
one-half by sunset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;All is not lost. When the sun goes down, with us
a mile apart, we shall be invisible; but they will crowd
all speed, and stand a good chance of coming up with
us again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we gain a chance to maneuver.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is hope and yet great risk in that, for if we
can throw them off the track we shall be safe, for we
can easily get beyond their range of vision long before
sunrise; but at the same time, in making these sharp
turns, we shall lose a great deal of ground, provided
we don&#8217;t succeed, and if they once get in sight of us
after the moon rises, the race will be ended, for we
won&#8217;t gain a chance to dodge them again.&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></div>
<p>&#8220;And then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be the worst fight you ever saw. We
shall have to begin by shooting these two, or pitching
them overboard, if they don&#8217;t happen to get their work
in ahead of us, and then we shall have more than
twenty savage islanders to keep off&ndash;&ndash;if we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are pretty well armed, Captain Fred.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we have our pistols, and there is a musket
apiece for you, me and Inez&ndash;&ndash;for she will have to take
a hand in the fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And there will be no braver than she. Have they
any firearms on board?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to say they have, and that&#8217;s what makes
me more anxious than anything else. There are
spears, knives, battle-axes and at least six loaded muskets,
and what is more, the men who have them in
hand know how to use them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mate Storms looked anxious, as well he might, for
this was a phase of the question which had not presented
itself to him. The case being as it was, the
pursuers would be likely to begin firing as soon as
they came within range, and when close in, the matter
would be entirely within their hands.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to augur ill for the fugitives.
The wind was steadily increasing and the flying proa
was dashing through the water at a tremendous rate.
The pursuing one had already shifted its course, so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
that this early in the afternoon the struggle had begun
and settled down to a virtual test of speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you suppose they think of the whole
business?&#8221; asked Mate Storms, looking back at the
double canoe as it rose on a huge swell at the same
moment that they themselves sank in the vast, watery
waste.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether they think anything is
wrong yet or not, but imagine I am trying to keep off
until after dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, then, don&#8217;t they respect your purpose and
work with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The leader of that company is an islander who is
somewhat jealous of me. He believes he knows more
about such business than I do, and he has made up his
mind to keep this in hand, no matter what my wishes
are. So, though he may think I mean all right, yet he
is sure he knows better, and governs himself accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These two men here on board try to look indifferent,
but they act suspiciously to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And they are suspicious, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred Sanders might have added further that they
were not only suspicious, but had actually discovered
the truth.</p>
<p>They understood the purpose which had brought all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
three to the lonely island, and they knew that that
purpose had been changed.</p>
<p>Inez Hawthorne, the girl of his own race, had
caused this wonderful transformation in the heart of
the young captain, and instead of being her enemy,
he had become the devoted friend of herself and companion.
While they could not understand the English
tongue as they heard it spoken, they could read
the meaning of looks and gestures and the confidential
talks which they saw going on around them. They
were convinced that their captain intended to betray
them, and prevent the wealth from falling into their
hands.</p>
<p>Would they submit?</p>
<p>Far from it. They would not only refuse to give
their assent to any such perfidy, but they would use
their utmost endeavors to defeat it. Such was their
purpose, and Fred Sanders knew it, for he understood
the character of the wretches; well, therefore, was it
that he whispered the warning in the ear of Mate
Abram Storms.</p>
<p>Inez Hawthorne sat at the front of the proa, in the
place that had been assigned her, for something
seemed to tell her that the men were so occupied with
their duties that it would be better for her to keep
away from them. It was with much reluctance that
she consented to exchange the few words with Captain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Fred Sanders, and little did she dream that it was
those same few words which turned the young man
from a deadly enemy into the most devoted ally, and
gave some promise of life to herself and her companion.
Yet, as we have shown, such was the fact.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h3>CLOSING IN</h3>
</div>
<p>When the sun sank in the western horizon, the
situation of the two craft had not materially changed.
The larger had perceptibly gained upon the smaller;
but a good distance still separated them, and
both parties were doing their utmost. The wind was
blowing stronger than at mid-day, but it was not such
a gale as had been feared, and our friends were not
without hope of eluding the natives, who were endeavoring
to overtake them.</p>
<p>Inez Hawthorne could not avoid seeing how matters
stood, though she was far from suspecting the whole
truth. Mr. Storms told her that the other boat contained
pirates, who were doing their utmost to overtake
them, and they were striving their hardest to prevent
it. As it stood, there was a prospect of a fight, in
which she would likely be called upon to take part.
She smiled, looked reverently upward, and said she
was ready whenever needed, and then she remained as
cool and watchful as either of her friends.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>Mr. Storms advised her not to go to sleep, as the
coming night must decide the case one way or the
other for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;No fear of my sleeping,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I realize our
position too well to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Inez,&#8221; whispered Storms, &#8220;these two savages
on board are the worst sort of men. Keep watch, and
do not place yourself in too dangerous a position
respecting them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have been alarmed more than once at their looks
and mutterings.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the sun went down, it was a curious sight when
the double canoe rose on a swell and was outlined
against the flaming disc behind, as we have described
the ship and the moon more than three years before.</p>
<p>The sight was a strange one, though it lasted but a
moment, when the craft went down, and the smaller
proa swiftly climbed the long slope of the watery
mountain in front. The round moon speedily rose in
the sky, and it was so bright that it was hard to tell
when twilight ended and its light began.</p>
<p>Never did Storms and Sanders long for utter darkness
more than on the present occasion. Had the
moon been obscured, they would have made a sharp
turn in their flight, with every prospect of throwing
the others completely off their trail, and with every
reason to hope for a clean escape before sunrise.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>But the flood of moon light prevented either proa
losing sight of the other.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing left to us now,&#8221; said the
young captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that&#8217;s to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we can do that. But I wish we were well
rid of these fellows with us. It puts us between two
fires, and there can be no doubt they suspect the
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure of that. Hello!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Storms had hold of the steering-oar, and Fred
was sitting close to him when he uttered the last exclamation,
and, springing forward, hastily drew his
pistol, took a quick aim and fired.</p>
<p>A frenzied howl followed, and one of the crew made
a furious plunge far out into the sea, and, going down
like a log, never came up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over with you, too!&#8221; shouted Sanders, in their
native tongue, his eyes flashing; &#8220;not an instant, or
I&#8217;ll shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>The savage did not hesitate, with his knife clenched
in his hand, and the young captain leveled his pistol
at him.</p>
<p>The sight of the muzzle so close to his skull, and the
finger resolutely pressing the trigger, were too much,
and the savage made a tremendous leap, like a tiger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
springing from his hiding-place, went far out into the
sea, and, quickly coming to the surface, blew the water
from his mouth, and began swimming with a swift,
powerful stroke in the direction of the pursuing boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you see that?&#8221; inquired Sanders, beginning
coolly to reload his pistol.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you know why I fired as quickly as I did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That wretch had drawn his knife, and was moving
in the direction of the unsuspecting Inez, sitting there.
I overheard him say something which aroused my suspicion,
and he was in the very act of raising his knife
when I fired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible? He deserved death, then, and you
finished him. But what purpose could they have in
killing an innocent girl like her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pure fiendishness&ndash;&ndash;that&#8217;s all. Then they meant
to make their attack upon us, and they would have
made things lively.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how much better it would have been had they
waited until the others attacked, when they could have
made a fatal diversion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly; but their course shows the nature
of the wretches. They are so fiendish and so eager to
fight that they have no judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we heading toward Wauparmur, Fred?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></div>
<p>&#8220;No; we are steering wide of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since, then, we are engaged in a regular chase for
that port, why not head straight for the island, so as
to have that advantage, at least?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, for there is nothing to be gained
by maneuvering to throw them off the track.&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred Sanders took a small compass from his pocket,
and studied it carefully for a minute or two by the
light of the moon. Then he gave directions to Storms
to bear more to the left, or the westward, until finally
he informed him that they were heading directly for
the port where all their hopes were now centered.</p>
<p>The wind fell slightly, but the pursuing boat
steadily gained, and it was impossible to see how
our friends could escape a hand-to-hand fight with the
pirates, and there could be but one issue to such an
encounter.</p>
<p>The islanders were thoughtful enough to lower
their immense sail, and stand by until they could pick
up their comrade struggling in the water, actuated
probably as much by curiosity to know the facts as by
humanity.</p>
<p>This gave our friends a show once more, and they
drew away from their pursuers; but, alas! not to an
extent to leave them out of sight, and until they could
do so, they could not hope to accomplish anything.</p>
<p>Mr. Storms was not without a strong hope of seeing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
some friendly sail, to which they could hasten for assistance,
and he continually searched the horizon, telling
Inez to do the same.</p>
<p>Captain Fred did not expect anything of that nature,
and, since the glasses were in his hands, he kept
them turned most of the time in the direction of the
double canoe, and called out his information and orders
to his mate at the helm.</p>
<p>Of course the distance was much less than a mile,
or the proa would scarcely have been discernible, but
the moonlight was strong, such as those who live in
temperate zones can hardly realize, and the illumination
of the sea was wonderfully brilliant.</p>
<p>Both Fred and Storms, who had spent years in the
South Seas, agreed that they had never seen anything
like it before, and, for all purposes, it might as well
have been broad day. The finest print could have
been read with ease, and the glasses leveled at the approaching
boat showed the crowds of swarthy pirates
on board, all as eager as wolves to come up with the
craft, which they were gaining so steadily upon.</p>
<p>And the fugitives knew well enough what the sequel
would be. The rival of Captain Fred would want no
better excuse for cutting him and his companions to
pieces, and the wealth in their possession would be
more &#8220;loot&#8221; than the same parties could obtain in a
dozen piratical expeditions.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<p>&#8220;But they shall never get a pennyworth of it!&#8221; said
Abe Storms to Fred.</p>
<p>The latter lowered his glass and looked inquiringly
at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it becomes absolutely certain that they have
got us, I shall throw all the pearls overboard, so that
they shall gain nothing more than our lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right; only,&#8221; said the young captain, with
a smile, &#8220;I advise you not to be in too much of a hurry
about it, for you will feel somewhat mortified if we
reach Wauparmur, after all, and you find you have
cast your whole wealth into the sea.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t lose my head,&#8221; said the mate, with a
laugh, &#8220;unless one of them takes it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inez Hawthorne was silent at the prow of the proa,
where she was looking for the longed-for sail, which,
alas! was never to appear, for she, too, had come to believe
there was no other hope for her and her friends.</p>
<p>Mate Storms and Captain Fred happened to turn
their heads at the same moment, and were looking at
the double proa coming up with them very rapidly,
when each uttered an exclamation, for they suddenly
saw a red flash at the prow of the boat, a puff of
smoke, and then the report of a musket reached them
almost at the same instant that the whistle of the bullet
through the rigging was heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;By George, they are firing at us!&#8221; said Fred, as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
if it was not the most natural thing in the world for
them to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and they&#8217;re aiming pretty well, too, for that
shot went through the sail!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly supposed they were near enough to do
that, but they are in earnest. Wouldn&#8217;t it be a good
idea to reply to their hail?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would, most undoubtedly!&#8221;</p>
<p>Putting up his glass, Captain Fred dived forward,
brought out one of the muskets, and taking deliberate
aim, fired at the approaching craft.</p>
<p>His shot was a fortunate one, too, for the cry which
instantly followed showed that some one was struck.
The others did not fire again for some time, but
seemed to concentrate all their energies and attention
upon the pursuit, which was turning more and more
every minute in their favor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see any escaping a fight,&#8221; said Fred Sanders.
&#8220;Inez says she hasn&#8217;t caught a glimpse of a sail,
and I am sure she won&#8217;t. We may as well bring our
guns here and be ready to repel boarders.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h3>WAUPARMUR</h3>
</div>
<p>Oftener than we suppose does heaven interfere directly
in the affairs of men. Minutes had passed since
Sanders and Storms had agreed that no earthly occurrence
could avert a fight with the dusky demons, with
scarcely a grain of hope for escape from them, when
Inez uttered the astounding exclamation:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are gaining on them!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was inconceivable, and the two looked again to
the rear to learn the cause of her unaccountable delusion.
Five minutes later Sanders added in a husky
gasp:</p>
<p>&#8220;She is right; we are not only gaining, but we are
gaining fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you account for it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t account for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; asked the amazed youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;God interposes many times when mortals do not
see it,&#8221; said the New Englander reverently; &#8220;there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
is joy in heaven over one sinner that repenteth. You
have repented, and He has extended his hand to help
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; replied Sanders, much
impressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>know</i> I am right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I hope to prove worthy of such undeserved
kindness. All I ask is the opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It shall be granted you. But, humanly speaking,
there has been some accident on board that craft
yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be that; as a sailor, you know any one of
a half dozen things would be sufficient to throw them
out of the race. A ripping of the sail, a fracture of
the mast, the breaking of the steering gear, or some
sudden quarrel would do the trick. Sufficient for us
is it to know that it has been done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God helps them that helps themselves,&#8221; added
Storms, &#8220;and we must improve to the utmost the
chance thrown in our way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Naturally the fear of the two was that their pursuers
might repair the accident which was throwing
them to the rear for the time, and regain what was
lost. They steadily fell behind, and, as soon as invisible,
the proa made an abrupt change in her course,
with the view of defeating the calamity that they
feared threatened them. When this had lasted for an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
hour, another change was effected, with the result, as
Sanders announced, that they were now heading
directly for Wauparmur.</p>
<p>The eyes peering backward through the vivid moonlight
failed to bring the dreaded craft to view, and it
was not yet midnight when Sanders announced the
thrilling fact that the twinkling lights, which appeared
in front like a constellation in the horizon,
were made by the dwellings in the native South Sea
town of Wauparmur. All danger was past, and about
an hour later the proa glided in among the shipping in
that excellent harbor, made fast to the wharf, and the
three disembarked.</p>
<p>Fred led the way to a house of entertainment near
the harbor, in which he found good lodging for his
friends.</p>
<p>Abram Storms carried all the precious pearls to his
room and carefully secured the door, after which he
threw himself upon the bed and slept as soundly as an
infant.</p>
<p>Inez Hawthorne, in the solitude of her apartment,
devoutly thanked her Heavenly Father for His care,
and then she, too, slept the sleep of exhaustion and
perfect health.</p>
<p>It was near noon on the succeeding day when both
rose and found Fred Sanders awaiting them. The
young man had not slept at all, and was uneasy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></div>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t do to stay here another night,&#8221; said he, in
explanation, as soon as the meal was concluded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure we have no wish to do so,&#8221; replied
Storms. &#8220;But wherein lies the particular peril?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That whole crew of the double canoe are scattered
through town, and they only await the chance to kill
us. They will find the chance, too, to-night, if we
remain here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what is the prospect of getting away?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in despair nearly all the forenoon; but a
little while ago I came upon a schooner which sails
for San Francisco at three o&#8217;clock this afternoon. I
have engaged passage on it for us three, for you know
I go with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can we ever repay you for your kindness?&#8221;
said Inez, her lustrous eyes speaking eloquently her
gratitude to the youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no service on earth that I can render you
which will compare with what you have done for me,&#8221;
was the reply of Captain Fred, whose manner showed
his sincerity. Inez Hawthorne did not understand
what all this meant, but the speaker ventured upon no
explanation at the time.</p>
<p>As the three were about to start upon a long voyage,
it was decided that some indispensable articles should
be procured, and, since they had little spare time at
command, the three set out immediately after dinner.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></div>
<p>Wauparmur, as we have already intimated, is a
town numbering several hundreds&ndash;&ndash;perhaps more
than a thousand&ndash;&ndash;in population. Among these are
a number of foreign shopkeepers, whose places are
close along shore, so as to be the more readily accessible
to their customers, who are almost exclusively
confined to those on board the vessels which stop at the
island.</p>
<p>Back from the town the land rises into hills, and
the settlement becomes straggling and scattered. In
these portions it is composed entirely of rude huts and
cabins, in which none but natives live, and they are a
bad lot.</p>
<p>It was from among those who lived in the &#8220;suburbs&#8221;
that the wretches were gathered with which to attempt
to capture and murder the little party of Europeans
for the sake of the invaluable pearls they had in their
possession.</p>
<p>Fred Sanders shuddered when he thought of the
risk he and his friends ran by going straight to the
inn and taking quarters for the night, for these miscreants
must, after all, have reached Wauparmur only
a few hours after the proa, and the wonder was that
they did not manage to slay the fugitives in their
beds.</p>
<p>The first thing Fred did in the morning was to slip
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
out and buy a revolver, and his second act was to
load it.</p>
<p>While engaged in hunting a vessel upon which to
take passage, he encountered his own acquaintances
continually, and he needed not their black faces and
scowling eyes to tell how they thirsted to kill him
for his treachery. It was only by his bold front and
constant watchfulness that he kept the dusky demons
at a distance. Some of them were seen when the three
ventured out, and though the pirates dared not attack
them in open daylight, they were on the verge of doing
so more than once. But their fury was directed principally
against Captain Fred Sanders, and there can
be no doubt the youth spoke the truth when he declared
that if he attempted to stay on land until morning,
he would not live till midnight.</p>
<p>Mr. Storms laid in a good supply of clothing, shoes
and knick-knacks for himself and Inez, and with as
little delay as possible. When they reached the wharf
and approached the plank leading to the deck of the
schooner, Mr. Storms noticed a small man standing a
few feet off, with a blanket drawn up about his
shoulders and neck like an Indian. His legs, feet and
head were bare, but a huge bandage was bound around
his forehead, giving him a grotesque appearance.</p>
<p>His position was like a statue, and he held the
blanket so high that little could be seen except his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
black, glittering eyes. Some distance off, on the street
close to the shop-houses, was a group of other natives,
who looked as if they were expecting some important
event.</p>
<p>So they were, indeed!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h3>HOMEWARD BOUND</h3>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Storms, do you notice that fellow?&#8221; asked Fred
Sanders, as they approached the plank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; it looks odd to see him standing there so motionless,
and yet with his eyes fixed upon us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s Weroo, the man who led that gang of pirates
last night, and he hates me with such a consuming
hate that he sent out his men to kill me, and in case
they fail to do so, he has stationed himself there with
the determination to assassinate me, for he is ready
to run any risk rather than allow me to get away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you prepared?&#8221; asked Storms, with no little
anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather guess so! Walk ahead with Inez and
leave him to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some hesitation, Storms did as requested,
though he placed his hand on his revolver, so as to
be ready for any emergency, the crew of the <i>Albatross</i>,
who were busying themselves around, seeming to hold
no suspicion of the situation.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></div>
<p>Just as Captain Fred put his foot on the plank, the
islander took a short step forward, like a panther
gathering himself for the leap upon its victim. At
that very instant, as if by intuition, Captain Fred
turned about and leveled his revolver at the muffled
figure, which paused. Every one who was looking on
supposed, of course, the boy was going to fire, but,
though his finger pressed the trigger, he did not discharge
his weapon. With the pistol pointed straight
at the savage, Fred slowly backed up the plank, keeping
his foe covered until he himself was on the deck
of the schooner.</p>
<p>The barbarian seemed paralyzed. After taking the
slight step forward, he paused and stood motionless,
staring and transfixed, until his victim was beyond his
reach. Then, without a word or exclamation, he
turned about, and strode away to where his infuriated
and discomfited comrades were watching him with not
the slightest doubt he would prevent the escape of the
white boy. Within the succeeding hour the <i>Albatross</i>
was standing down the bay, with all sail spread; and
her long voyage to distant California was begun.</p>
<p>Ah, that journey from the South Seas across the
equator and northward into the stern climate of the
Temperate Zone!</p>
<p>Not one of those who participated in it can forget
it to his dying day. They had many hours of fierce,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
wild weather, in which the <i>Albatross</i> was more than
once in danger, but Captain Hardy was a good sailor,
he had a good crew, and he safely rode through it all.</p>
<p>Then came those delightful nights which seem peculiar
to the Pacific, when the moonlight takes on a
witchery of its own, and the calm sea becomes like an
enchanted lake as the vessel glides over it.</p>
<p>Captain Hardy was a kind man as well as a skilful
sailor, and, since he received a most liberal price for
the passage of the three persons who joined him at
Wauparmur, the best treatment was given them.</p>
<p>It was on this homeward voyage that Captain Fred
Sanders told to Mate Storms and Inez Hawthorne the
story of his life, the main points of which have
already been hinted to the reader. He ran away from
his home in San Francisco when but a mere boy,
scarcely ten years old. He was led into all sorts of
evil, and was so deeply implicated in a fierce mutiny
that, as we have said, he would have been strung up
at the yard-arm, excepting for his extreme youth.</p>
<p>He then joined a trading vessel in the South Seas,
but the crew were attacked and massacred by a band
of pirates, and he was taken off a prisoner. These
pirates belonged to the Wauparmur settlement, and
they were so pleased with the bravery displayed by the
boy that they adopted him among them. There was
something in the life which was attractive to the wild
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
American lad, and he embraced it eagerly, and spent
five years among them. His bravery, skill, and natural
&#8220;smartness,&#8221; advanced him rapidly along the line
of promotion, until, while yet a boy, he became an
acknowledged leader.</p>
<p>Captain Fred spent a portion of his time in the
settlement, where he showed his good sense, in one
respect at least, by picking up all the education he
could from the instructors who were to be found there.
He succeeded well&ndash;&ndash;which will explain the intelligence
he displayed in this respect while conversing
with his friends.</p>
<p>He confessed all this, and said further that his
mother died before he ran away, and he had no idea
where his father was; but, if he were alive, the son
determined to find him, no matter where he might be
on the broad earth. Now that his conscience had
been awakened, his affection came back with it, and
his great fear was that he would not see his parent
alive.</p>
<p>It was a source of never-ending wonder to Fred
Sanders how it was he could have been so wicked a
lad, and how it was that his moral sense could have
been so totally eclipsed for years. The gentle, winning
words of Inez Hawthorne had first aroused his
conscience, until finally it would not allow him to rest
until he had made his peace with it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
</div>
<p>Many a long hour did the two&ndash;&ndash;Fred and Inez&ndash;&ndash;spend
in talking together of the past and their future.
They were as brother and sister to each other, and
their prospects were discussed as if it were fixed that
they should never lose sight of each other again.</p>
<p>It was on this voyage, too, that Abram Storms disclosed
the plan of action he had decided upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pearls which I have in my possession I shall
dispose of in San Francisco&ndash;&ndash;or at least a portion of
them. Those which were my share, according to the
original agreement, I shall keep. The single pearl,
which will doubtless bring a large price in New York,
is the property of Inez, and shall be devoted to her
benefit. I intend to place her in a school and make
a systematic effort to trace her parentage. The pearls
left by Captain Bergen go to you, Fred.&#8221;</p>
<p>But here occurred the first stumbling-block. Fred
Sanders refused pointedly, but firmly, to accept a
single one of them. He declared he had no claim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
upon any one of that little party, and he would not
suffer himself to be dissuaded from his position.</p>
<p>He was yet young, vigorous and ambitious, and
with the help of heaven he would carve out his own
fortune. Seeing it was useless to argue the question,
Storms fell back upon the original intention of Captain
Bergen, which was to devote the greater portion
of his wealth to charity.</p>
<p>In due time, the <i>Albatross</i> glided through the
Golden Gate, and our friends found themselves in
San Francisco, whose streets all had trod years before.</p>
<p>The first thing Storms did after establishing Inez
in pleasant quarters was to hunt up the mother of
Captain Bergen, and he prosecuted his search with a
heavy heart, bearing the bad news which he did. He
was relieved to find that she had been dead fully two
years, and the nearest relative of the captain remaining
was his cousin, who was in such affluent circumstances
that Storms decided not to give him any portion
of the wealth left by the deceased captain.</p>
<p>While Abe Storms was engaged upon his duty,
young Fred Sanders was busy.</p>
<p>Although he had revealed a great deal of his past
life, there remained one great secret, which he had
reserved as a final surprise, especially to Inez Hawthorne,
who, as yet, had not formed the slightest idea
of what was coming. And what this secret was, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
the particulars of not one but two astounding discoveries,
we will now proceed to relate.</p>
<p>The grim old sailor, Captain Strathmore, of the
steamer <i>Polynesia</i>, has made many voyages between
San Francisco and the Imperial Japanese city of
Tokio since we last saw him, more than three years
ago. There is little change, however, in his appearance,
and the same kindly heart, tempered in the furnace
of affliction and sorrow, throbs beneath his rough
exterior. There are few officers holding such a responsible
position as he who are greater favorites with
the multitudes that go down to the sea in ships, and he
promises to perform many valuable years of service
to his employers, who appreciate the sterling worth of
the brave, noble man.</p>
<p>The steamer has been at the dock several days, and
soon is to leave for her long voyage across the Pacific.
The captain is sitting in his cabin, reading and writing
some letters. By-and-by he lays down his pen,
and wheeling his chair around, gives utterance to his
thoughts, as he has grown in the habit of doing of late.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall keep in harness till I die, for idleness would
take me off in a short time. I have striven to do my
duty to God and my fellow-man&ndash;&ndash;and though much
sorrow has come to me, yet I shall never murmur nor
complain, when I see so much around me and know
that no race and no place in society is exempt from it.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Years ago I placed away my beloved wife in the
distant New England hills, and then when the fair
bud which she left behind blossomed, that, too, was
gathered by the angels and I was left alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;The darling son upon whom I centered all my
hopes was a wild, wayward boy, and he left my roof
and has never come back again. Whether he is
or is not, I cannot tell, but I fear that, if he still
treads the earth, he is sowing the wind and will reap
the whirlwind. I have striven to forget that I was
ever afflicted in being the parent of such a child. But
alas, the roots of affection are planted so deep that it
is hard to withdraw them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then there came to me a second Inez, and I loved
her as I did the first. Just as she nestled around my
heart, she was taken away in the most surprising manner.
I believed then that I should see and clasp her
again in my arms. But the years have come and
gone, and still she comes not to me. Ah! could I but
hear the music of that voice&ndash;&ndash;could I but feel those
dimpled arms about my neck as I used to do&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;Helloa!&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Fred Sanders walked briskly into the
cabin, doffed his hat, made a bow, laughed and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Helloa, pop! how are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Captain Strathmore gasped, stared and replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;No&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;no&ndash;&ndash;Fred. Is that you, my own boy?&#8221;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></div>
<p>And Fred laughed, and then, with tears in his eyes,
leaped forward and threw his arms about the old captain&#8217;s
neck and cried like a child, while the parent,
fondly caressing him, cried too, and for a minute
neither could speak an intelligible word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pop,&#8221; finally said the youth, raising his head and
sitting upon the strong knee, &#8220;I have been a bad boy.
I have brought trouble to you, but I have come thousands
of miles to ask your forgiveness and to try to
cheer your declining years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about declining years for,
you young rascal? I never was so strong and hearty
in my life. You have made me twenty years younger!
Ah, if your mother could but see this! But she is
smiling in heaven over it, and so is our darling Inez,
who joined her long ago. God be thanked! my boy is
dead but is alive again!&#8221;</p>
<p>And, laughing and crying, they shook hands, and
talked and talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me everything that has befallen you, my dear
son.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Fred did so, as we have already told the
reader, adding that he never so far forgot himself as
to dishonor his father by bearing his name. He was
known everywhere as Frederic Sanders, whereas his
full name was Frederic Sanders Strathmore&ndash;&ndash;which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
he was now proud to assume, and which, with God&#8217;s
help, he meant to honor.</p>
<p>They sat a long time in loving converse, and,
finally, Captain Strathmore told the story of Inez
Hawthorne, who came to and went from him in such
an extraordinary manner, and for whom he sighed
and longed as he had for his own child, taken from
him years before.</p>
<p>Fred smiled in an odd way, while this story was
being told, and then asked his father to walk down to
the Occidental Hotel with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have some very particular business,&#8221; he added,
&#8220;and will take it as a great favor if you will so so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will,&#8221; responded the cheery old captain,
springing to his feet. &#8220;I will walk if I can, but
I feel more like flying; and if there&#8217;s any more good
news, I&#8217;ll set up a dancing and yelling carnival.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there is good news awaiting you, so you had
better get ready to put on the brakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, Fred?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, and you will see.&#8221;</p>
<p>A few minutes later there was a gentle tap on the
door of Inez Hawthorne&#8217;s room at the Occidental.
She was busy sewing, and she called out in a somewhat
startled voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221;</p>
<p>Fred Strathmore threw the door wide open, and,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
taking hold of his father&#8217;s arm, gave him such a vigorous
shove that he was forced several steps into the
apartment before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>He caught sight of a beautiful, scared face, which
stared with something like terror at him for a moment;
and then there was a scream, and she made one
bound forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, father, father! my own dear father! I am so
glad!&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the arms were about the neck of the weather-beaten
sea-dog; again the kisses were showered upon
his bronzed face; again his own lost Inez was in his
arms.</p>
<p>Poor Captain Strathmore broke down completely.
Instead of shouting and dancing, as he threatened to
do, he sat in his chair, and, with Inez on his knee,
overrunning with joy, delight and supreme happiness,
he could do nothing but cry, cry, cry, and murmur
his gratitude and thankfulness.</p>
<p>But, after a time, he did recover himself; and then
he became aware for the first time, as did the others,
that a fourth party was present. This was Mate
Storms, who suspected the situation before he was introduced
to the happy captain of the <i>Polynesia</i>.
Since they all had such an extraordinary story to relate,
the captain had an equally remarkable one to tell
them.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></div>
<p>The persistent and never-ending investigation
which he set on foot concerning the lost Inez had resulted,
not in finding her, but in unearthing her entire
history.</p>
<p>She was a native of the city of New York, and her
father died there before she was a year old. A former
suitor of her mother, angered because she would not
become his wife, even after her husband was deceased,
resorted to the atrocious revenge of stealing Inez
when she was but an infant, and he hastened across
the continent with her.</p>
<p>When he had kept her there a brief time, he sought
to open negotiations with the mother, with a view
of delivering back her child on condition that the parent
should become his wife; but he was shocked to
learn that the poor, heartbroken mother had died
from grief, and the child was upon his hands.</p>
<p>This man finally married a woman in San Francisco,
but neither of them could ever feel any affection
for the little girl (whom, however, they treated quite
fairly), and the wife insisted that she should be gotten
rid of in some way. Through some whim or other, the
abductor had always called her by her right name&ndash;&ndash;Inez
Hawthorne&ndash;&ndash;and, seeing some mention of it in
the newspapers, he resorted to the means which we
described, at the opening of this story, for ridding
himself forever of her.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>As soon as Inez was safely placed on the steamer,
this wicked couple disappeared, and no further trace
of them could be found. Captain Strathmore, who
was anxious to punish them, believed they had left the
country. Inez, therefore, was an orphan, and while
a gentle sadness filled her affectionate heart&ndash;&ndash;as she
heard the particulars of her own history for the first
time, and reflected upon that poor, heartbroken
mother, who had gone to her rest long ago&ndash;&ndash;she could
not feel any poignant grief, for her memory of the
lost one was too shadowy and faint. But she had
found a home and friends for life.</p>
<p>Abram Storms explained that he had met three
English gentlemen who were making a tour of the
world in a large steam yacht; and, since they possessed
abundant means, and were very social, he had
shown them the pearls in his possession and offered to
dispose of them all. They were delighted with the
specimens, and especially with the enormous one belonging
to Inez. They offered twenty-five thousand
dollars for the single one, and just one hundred thousand
for the rest. This was less than Storms had
counted upon&ndash;&ndash;and doubtless less than he could have
secured by consulting leading lapidaries in other parts
of the world&ndash;&ndash;but he was inclined to end the transaction
by accepting it, and he asked the advice of his
friends. After fully discussing the matter, it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
agreed to close with the offer, and the exchange was
completed that afternoon, and the money belonging to
Inez was placed in the bank the next morning.</p>
<p>Since Storms was anxious to return to his home,
and since there was no call for his remaining longer in
San Francisco, it was arranged that Inez should enter
an excellent school in the Golden Gate City, where
she should spend several years, while Captain Strathmore
was to act as her guardian until she should
attain her legal majority. The captain&#8217;s position enabled
him to find a berth under him for Fred on the
steamer <i>Polynesia</i>, and the boy sailed with him on the
next voyage to Tokio, and on many a subsequent one.</p>
<p>Abe Storms is as poor as he was before he made his
voyage to the South Seas, for, having dedicated the
wealth left by Captain Bergen to charitable purposes,
he felt it his duty to do the same with his own, and,
since he has no one besides himself dependent upon
him, he is not troubled by fears of not being able to
make a comfortable living.</p>
